Our research group applies interdisciplinary engineering approaches to address multiscale research challenges in <strong> manufacturing sustainability </strong> and <strong> mechanics of multilayered systems</strong>. Our group includes members from the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Environmental & Ecological Engineering.   

Some of our current research interests include:
<li> industrial decarbonization strategies </li>
<li> environmental life cycle assessment for early-stage manufacturing technologies </li>
<li> sustainable supply chains and circularity </li>
<li> fracture mechanics in multilayer systems </li>
<li> adhesion of paints and coatings </li>
