William (Will) Lewis joined Professor Liddellâ€™s research lab in 2025 as a PhD student interested in advancing lifecycle assessment methodology and community focused decarbonization and climate resilience projects. His research focuses on the application of environmentally extended input-output models (EEIO) as a tool for properly pricing harmful emissions into market data. Prior to Purdue, Will completed several research projects and an honors thesis at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. These efforts included quantifying microplastics in the Seneca Lake Watershed, analyzing the interaction between lake effect snow bands and atmospheric fronts, and quantifying the racial disparity in indoor environmental quality. Will also spent two years as a municipal consultant, writing grants and strategic plans for municipalities, non-profits, and developers. In his free time, Will can often be found working on his car, learning new woodworking techniques, enjoying nature, and sailing.
