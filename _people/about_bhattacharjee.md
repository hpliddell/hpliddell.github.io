Tripta Bhattacharjee is a graduate student in Environmental & Ecological Engineering, co-advised by Prof. Liddell and [Prof. John Mulrow]( https://engineering.purdue.edu/EEE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=274459). He studies the net impacts of decarbonization projects, including potentially unexpected rebound effects of these initiatives. Prior to coming to Purdue, Tripta pursued interdisciplinary research spanning traffic studies, fire resistance simulations, and distribution pipe scalability, with two projects published in international conferences (see below). He also contributed to a UK-funded [Living Deltas]( https://livingdeltas.org/) sustainability project, analyzing land use and water quality relationships. A self-described "generalist," Tripta enjoys reading across genres, exploring theoretical solutions to abstract ideas, and dreams of delivering his own TED talk someday. An avid Arsenal fan and soccer enthusiast, he hopes his future career as an environmental engineer or sustainability specialist leaves time for his other passions.
