Beth Kelley is currently pursuing her M.S. in Environmental & Ecological Engineering, and also received her B.S. here at Purdue (also in Environmental and Ecological Engineering). Beth is currently working with Prof. Liddell to develop a physically and environmentally extended input-output model of the U.S. manufacturing sector, which will be used for industrial decarbonization pathways analysis. Beth is passionate about bridging the gap between environmental policy and engineering, and hopes to continue working in sustainability engineering following the completion of her graduate program. Some fun facts about Beth are that she can "sing the ABC’s with her mouth closed"**, she has 4 older sisters, and <em>Avatar the last Airbender</em> is her all-time favorite show.

 ** Editor’s note: pending verification; we are still waiting for a demo of this skill at group meeting.
