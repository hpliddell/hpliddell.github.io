Beth Kelley graduated in 2025 with her M.S. in Environmental & Ecological Engineering at Purdue. She worked with Prof. Liddell to develop a physically and environmentally extended input-output model of the U.S. manufacturing sector. Beth is passionate about bridging the gap between environmental policy and engineering and is excited to continue working in sustainability engineering following the completion of her graduate program. Some fun facts about Beth are that she can "sing the ABC’s with her mouth closed"**, she has 4 older sisters, and <em>Avatar the last Airbender</em> is her all-time favorite show.

 ** Editor’s note: we are still waiting for a demo of this skill at group meeting.
