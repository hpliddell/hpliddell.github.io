Sanatkumar (“Sanat”) Rajagopalan graduated with his MS in Mechanical Engineering in 2025. He worked with Professor Liddell on environmentally extended global input-output models, including a project exploring differences in food chain emissions for North American and Southeast Asian contexts. He is passionate about boosting sustainability within the industrial and commercial sectors. Prior to Purdue, he worked at the consulting firm [CleanMax]( https://www.cleanmax.com/) developing utility scale wind and solar projects in India. If a career in energy and sustainability does not work out, he hopes to become either a professional photographer or a chef :)
