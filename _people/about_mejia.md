Catherinne (“Cathy”) Mejia is from El Salvador and holds a bachelor's degree in Environment and Development Engineering from [Zamorano University]( https://zamorano.edu/en/) (Honduras). She is currently a Master's Student in Environmental and Ecological Engineering (EEE) at Purdue, co-advised by Prof. Liddell and Prof. [Deandrae Smith](https://ag.purdue.edu/directory/smit4870) (Food Science). Her research involves drying dairy forage with a radio-frequency dryer while conducting a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to measure environmental impacts. Catherinne is interested in interdisciplinary research that aims to reduce environmental impacts and promote sustainability of the production chain, with a focus on agriculture and industry. In her free time, she enjoys baking, hiking, and spending time with friends.
