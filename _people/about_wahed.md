Zubair Wahed is a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering, co-advised by [Prof. Kejie Zhao]( https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=113514) and Prof. Liddell. His research project focuses on studying adhesion challenges in lithium ion batteries. Currently, he is using a range of adhesion strength testing techniques to study the bond between the current collector and active material layer, which can deteriorate over repeated charge-discharge cycles. He hopes his research can contribute to making lithium ion batteries more efficient, safe, reliable, and ecologically friendly. A true engineer at heart, Zubair also enjoys tinkering with microcontroller systems, robotics, and personal 3D printing projects in his free time.
