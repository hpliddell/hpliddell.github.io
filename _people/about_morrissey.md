Andrew Morrissey is an MS student in Mechanical Engineering from Wildwood, Missouri. He has been part of the Liddell Research Group since his junior year at Purdue. His undergraduate research  focused on mapping environmental burden-shifting effects in international trade and assessing the impacts of these effects on nation-level industrial decarbonization metrics. Now, for his graduate thesis project, he is investigating the integration of Lean Six Sigma practices with sustainability decision-making in an Industry 4.0 testbed at [IN-MaC]( https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/in-mac/facilities/intelligent-manufacturing-testbed). A few of Andrewâ€™s hobbies include playing soccer, spending time with friends, lifting, and studying Japanese.
