	abstract = {In electric and hybrid vehicles Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), batteries play a central role and are in the spotlight of scientiﬁc community and public opinion. Automotive batteries constitute, together with the powertrain, the main diﬀerences between electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles. For this reason, many decision makers and researchers wondered whether energy and environmental impacts from batteries production, can exceed the beneﬁts generated during the vehicle’s use phase. In this framework, the purpose of the present literature review is to understand how large and variable the main impacts are due to automotive batteries’ life cycle, with particular attention to climate change impacts, and to support researchers with some methodological suggestions in the ﬁeld of automotive batteries’ LCA. The results show that there is high variability in environmental impact assessment; CO2eq emissions per kWh of battery capacity range from 50 to 313 g CO2eq/kWh. Nevertheless, either using the lower or upper bounds of this range, electric vehicles result less carbon-intensive in their life cycle than corresponding diesel or petrol vehicles.},

This paper compares the results obtained by various authors in terms of life cycle assessment (LCA) of EV and conventional vehicles powered by fossil fuels, and the life cycle cost (LCC) analysis of the both types of vehicles, as every new technology comes with an additional cost which need to be feasible with respect to the present trends. And also discuss some of the software used for both type of LCA and LCC analysis. The ﬁnding of review concludes that with the adoption of EV there is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) but there is an increase in the human toxicity level due to the larger use of metals, chemicals and energy for the production of powertrain, and high voltage batteries. And in terms of cost it has ﬂexible pricing as there is uncertainty in pricing of future gasoline and electricity mix, higher initial cost at the time of purchasing due to higher pricing of battery.},

	abstract = {The world needs to rapidly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to stave off the risks of disastrous climate change. In particular, decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing industries is particularly challenging due to the specific process requirements. This study estimates the potential for future CO2 emission reductions in this important sector. The analysis is a detailed accounting exercise that relies on estimates of emission-reduction potential from other studies and applies those potentials to the manufacturing sector using a bottom-up approach. The actions are grouped into four “pillars” that support deep decarbonization of manufacturing (DDM): Energy Efficiency, Material Efficiency, Industry-Specific, and Power Grid. Based on this bottom-up approach, the analysis shows that an 86\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the Reference Case is feasible. No single pillar dominates DDM, although opportunities vary widely by sub-sector. The analysis shows that a strategy incorporating a broad set of elements from each pillar can be effective instead of relying on any single pillar. Some pillars, such as Energy Efficiency and Material Efficiency, have wide applicability; others have key niche roles that are Industry-Specific; the Power Grid pillar requires interaction between grid decarbon­ ization and industry action to switch from fossil fuels to zero-carbon electricity where appropriate.},

Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) are two most often applied batteries to power these vehicles. Given this context, this study aims to compare life cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions of BEVs and PHEVs, both of which are powered by LFP and NMC batteries. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted, concerning electricity generation mix, lifetime mileage, utility factor, and battery recycling. BEVs are found to be less emission-intensive than PHEVs given the existing and near-future electricity generation mix in China, and the energy consumption and GHG emissions of a BEV are about 3.04\% (NMC) to 9.57\% (LFP) and 15.95\% (NMC) to 26.32\% (LFP) lower, respectively, than those of a PHEV.},

USEEIO melds data on economic transactions between 389 industry sectors with environmental data for these sectors covering land, water, energy and mineral usage and emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria air pollutants, nutrients and toxics, to build a life cycle model of 385 US goods and services. In comparison with existing US models, USEEIO is more current with most data representing year 2013, more extensive in its coverage of resources and emissions, more deliberate and detailed in its interpretation and combination of data sources, and includes formal data quality evaluation and description. USEEIO is assembled with a new Python module called the IO Model Builder capable of assembling and calculating results of userdefined input-output models and exporting the models into LCA software. The model and data quality evaluation capabilities are demonstrated with an analysis of the environmental performance of an average hospital in the US.

We ﬁnd that PEVs can have larger or smaller carbon footprints than gasoline vehicles, depending on these regional factors and the speciﬁc vehicle models being compared. The Nissan Leaf battery electric vehicle has a smaller carbon footprint than the most efﬁcient gasoline vehicle (the Toyota Prius) in the urban counties of California, Texas and Florida, whereas the Prius has a smaller carbon footprint in the Midwest and the South. The Leaf is lower emitting than the Mazda 3 conventional gasoline vehicle in most urban counties, but the Mazda 3 is lower emitting in rural Midwest counties. The Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid electric vehicle has a larger carbon footprint than the Prius throughout the continental US, though the Volt has a smaller carbon footprint than the Mazda 3 in many urban counties. Regional grid mix, temperature, driving conditions, and vehicle model all have substantial implications for identifying which technology has the lowest carbon footprint, whereas regional patterns of VMT have a much smaller effect. Given the variation in relative GHG implications, it is unlikely that blunt policy instruments that favor speciﬁc technology categories can ensure emission reductions universally.},

We explored resource availability and synergies by region in the United States and conducted cost and environmental analysis to identify unique opportunities in each region to inform possible regional and national actions for carbon capture and utilization development. This study estimated production cost of synthetic methanol and Fischer− Tropsch (FT) fuels by using CO2 captured from the waste streams emitted from six industrial [ethanol, ammonia, natural gas (NG) processing, hydrogen, cement, and iron/steel production plants] and two power generation (coal and NG) processes across the United States. The results showed that a total of 1594 million metric ton per year of waste CO2 can be captured and converted into 85 and 319 billion gallons of FT fuels and methanol, respectively. FT fuels can potentially substitute for 36\% of the total petroleum fuels used in the transportation sector in 2018. Technoeconomic analysis shows that the minimum selling prices for synthetic FT fuels and methanol are 1.8−2.8 times the price of petroleum fuel/chemicals, but the total CO2 reduction potential is 935−1777 MMT/year.},

In this article, the U.S. steel ﬂow is modeled as a series of nodes representing processes and products. An easily updatable nonlinear least squares optimization is used to reconcile the inconsistencies across 293 collated data records on ﬂows through and between the nodes. The data come from an integrated analysis that includes top-down estimates of steel ﬂow from trade bodies and government statistical agencies, bottom-up estimates of the steel embedded in products based on production statistics and bills of materials, and the mass of imports and exports based on international money ﬂow. A weighting methodology is used to consistently assign conﬁdence scores to the data, and the optimization is used to achieve mass balance and minimize the sum of the squares of the weighted residuals. The results indicate that yield improvement eﬀorts should focus on sheet metal forming in the car industry, which accounts for nearly half of all generated fabrication scrap. The quantity of end-of-life scrap exported and land-ﬁlled is greater than the quantity of steel products imported. Increased domestic recycling of end-of-life scrap might displace around a third of these imports.},

	abstract = {Decarbonization of the industrial process heat supply through electrification could contribute significantly to climate change mitigation efforts. In the U.S. industry, thermal processes accounted for more than two-thirds of the total final energy demand in 2021. Cross-cutting electrification technologies like industrial heat pumps are suitable for the process heat supply to several industrial unit operations in a sustainable way while also improving overall energy efficiency. This study employs a bottom-up approach to investigate the techno-enviroeconomic potentials of deploying high-temperature and steam-generating heat pumps in the major U.S. food manufacturing sectors in different timeframes. The results show that the annual technical potential energy and CO2 savings by electrifying process heat supply are 325 PJ (or approximately 20\% of the total final energy demand in U.S. food manufacturing) and 31 MtCO2 (equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions from over 6 million cars in the U.S.) in 2050, respectively; however, these incur additional costs in each sector. Although there may be individual cost-effective opportunities for electrifying heat supply in specific industrial sites, the overall costs are estimated to be high in the food sectors due to the large disparity between electricity and natural gas prices and low heat source temperatures. To overcome the identified techno-economic barriers, comprehensive action plans for different stakeholders are needed. This study provides novel insights that should inform policymakers’ and executives’ decisions about the electrification of the current and future U.S. industrial heat supply in relevant industrial sectors.},

	abstract = {We compiled 50 publications from the years 2005–2020 about life cycle assessment (LCA) of Li-ion batteries to assess the environmental eﬀects of production, use, and end of life for application in electric vehicles. Investigated LCAs showed for the production of a battery pack per kWh battery capacity a median of 280 kWh/kWh\_bc (25\%-quantile–75\%-quantile: 200–500 kWh/kWh\_bc) for the primary energy consumption and a median of 120 kg CO2-eq/kWh\_bc (25\%-quantile–75\%-quantile: 70–175 kg CO2-eq/kWh\_bc) for greenhouse gas emissions. We expect results for current batteries to be in the lower range. Over the lifetime of an electric vehicle, these emissions relate to 20 g CO2-eq/km (25\%-quantile–75\%-quantile: 10–50 g CO2-eq/km). Considering recycling processes, greenhouse gas savings outweigh the negative environmental impacts of recycling and can reduce the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by a median value of 20 kg CO2-eq/kWh\_bc (25\%-quantile–75\%-quantile: 5–29 kg CO2-eq/kWh\_bc). Overall, many LCA results overestimated the environmental impact of cell manufacturing, due to the assessments of relatively small or underutilized production facilities. Material emissions, like from mining and especially processing from metals and the cathode paste, could have been underestimated, due to process-based assumptions and non-regionalized primary data. Second-life applications were often not considered.},

	abstract = {Wood pallets play a critical role in the movement and storage of goods worldwide. They are an important component in the complex global supply chain and used by almost every industry. It is therefore important to assess the environmental implications of the wood pallet supply chain and identify optimization strategies that can be implemented. In this paper, primary 2018 annual production data collected from U.S. pallet manufac­ turers were used to develop the first industry-average life-cycle inventory (LCI). A new functional unit was proposed to perform a more refined and accurate environmental life-cycle assessment of the wood pallet supply chain. Using the LCI data developed, a cradle-to-grave industry-average life-cycle impact assessment was per­ formed. This novel approach quantifies environmental impacts of a generic multi-use pallet, including repair and remanufacturing. The total global warming impact was 10.4 kg CO2e per 45.4 t of pallet loads of product delivered using wood pallets. The manufacturing stage contributed the most, about 35\%, followed by the raw material supply stage. About 41\% of total primary energy consumption was from renewable sources, with most sourced from biomass. Fossil fuels comprised about 52\% of the total (225 MJ per functional unit) primary energy consumption. Total environmental impact was significantly affected by two main parameters: reference service life and load-bearing capacity. Pallet repair was also found to be an important component of the wood pallet supply chain, which has a low environmental footprint compared with the overall impact of a pallet and enables mitigation of overall impact by extending the reference service life. At end-of-life, common industry practices demonstrated substantial potential environmental benefits that can minimize overall environmental impact.},

We model a suite of life cycle GHG emissions considerations to estimate the GHG abatement potential from switching from an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICE) to an EV in the continental U.S. The GHG intensity of EVs hinges on the electricity and ambient temperature when charged and operated. Both have high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, yet are typically modeled inadequately or overlooked entirely. We calculate marginal emissions, including renewables, for electricity by region and test forecasted grid composition to estimate future performance. Location and timing of charging are important GHG determinants, but temperature eﬀects on EV performance can be equally important. On average, EVs slightly reduce GHGs relative to ICEs, but there are many regions where EVs provide a decisive beneﬁt and others where EVs are signiﬁcantly worse. The forecasted grid shifts from coal towards renewables, improving EV performance; the GHG beneﬁt per EV in western states is roughly \$425 today and \$2400 in 2040.},

In this review, we attempted to provide an overview of different types of natural fibers, their characteristics and properties enabling them to be used as reinforcing agents in different polymers. Then the unique requirement of fiber surface modification to achieve enhanced fiber-matrix bonding is discussed. The article also discusses conventional processing routes and critical issues associated with NFRCs processing. The use of different additive manufacturing (AM) technologies in processing polymer composites is also discussed.

While early assessments provide the greatest opportunity to influence design and ultimately environmental performance, it is the stage with the least available data, greatest uncertainty, and a paucity of analytic tools for addressing these challenges. While the fundamental approach to conducting an LCA of emerging technologies is akin to that of LCA of existing technologies, emerging technologies pose additional challenges. In this paper, we present a broad set of market and technology characteristics that typically influence an LCA of emerging technologies and identify questions that researchers must address to account for the most important aspects of the systems they are studying. The paper presents: (a) guidance to identify the specific technology characteristics and dynamic market context that are most relevant and unique to a particular study, (b) an overview of the challenges faced by early stage assessments that are unique because of these conditions, (c) questions that researchers should ask themselves for such a study to be conducted, and (d) illustrative examples from the transportation sector to demonstrate the factors to consider when conducting LCAs of emerging technologies. The paper is intended to be used as an organizing platform to synthesize existing methods, procedures and insights and guide researchers, analysts and technology developer to better recognize key study design elements and to manage expectations of study outcomes.},

	abstract = {Worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have been steadily increasing for several years and now account for several million vehicles, resulting in a high use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). It is then required to assess the real environmental impact of these LIBs and to avoid environmental impacts’ transfers. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology seems the most appropriate framework as it is a multi-stages and environmental multi-criteria ISO methodology. However, many studies exist on this subject and no consensus is emerging on a common environmental value of LIB’s production. To fill this gap and properly assess the environmental con­ sequences of a massive electrification deployment, this study performs a qualitative and a quantitative review of more than 500 LCA studies referring to LIBs’ production for BEVs. 377 observations for seven selected variables among more than 80 surveyed variables are presented and meta-analysis (MA) methodology is used to compare the final 32 selected studies. After many statistical tests and 8 finalists selected, we find that the global warming potential (GWP) impact of mobile LIBs’ production can be explained by a reduced parametrized model con­ taining four information: the geographical location of the corresponding author, the cell design of the battery, the battery specific energy, and the manufacturing energy. This allows a generic and systematic approach to assess GWP impacts of LIBs production. We also propose recommendations for LCA practitioners to harmonize LIBs’ environmental assessments and save time for further analysis.},

Testing included coastdown testing on a test track to determine the drag forces and road load at each test weight for each vehicle. Many quality measures were used to ensure only mass variations impact the road load measurements. Chassis dynamometer testing was conducted over standard drive cycles on each vehicle at multiple test weights to determine the fuel consumption or electrical energy consumption impact caused by change in vehicle mass. The road load measurements obtained from the coastdown testing were used to configure the chassis dynamometer. Chassis dynamometer testing also incorporated many quality controls to ensure accurate results.},

	abstract = {A thorough assessment of Life-Cycle eﬀects involved by vehicle lightweighting needs a rigorous evaluation of mass-induced consumption, on which energy and sustainability beneﬁts during use stage directly depend. The paper proposes an analytical calculation procedure to estimate the weight-related energy consumption of pure Electric Vehicles (EVs), since existing literature leaves considerable room for improvement regarding this research area. The correlation between consumption and mass is expressed through the Energy Reduction Value (ERV) coeﬃcient, which quantiﬁes the speciﬁc consumption saving achievable through 100 kg mass reduction. The ERV is estimated for a number of heterogeneous case studies derived from real 2019 European market EV models and according to three drive cycles, to consider diﬀerent driving behaviors. For the case studies under consideration, ERV ranges from 0.47 to 1.17 kWh/(100 km × 100 kg), with the variability mainly depending on vehicle size and driving cycle. Given the high uncertainty of mass-related consumption on car size, an analytical method is reﬁned to estimate accurately the ERV for any real-world EV model, starting from vehicle technical features. Along with energy assessment, the research also evaluates the environmental implications of lightweight design by means of the Impact Reduction Value (IRV), which is estimated for three distinct electricity grid mixes. Finally, the ERV/IRV modeling approach is applied to a series of comparative lightweight case studies taken from the literature. Such an application demonstrates the eﬀective utility of the work to reduce the uncertainty for all cases where no physical tests or computer-aided simulations are available.},

The profusion of pallets in today’s supply chain warrants the investigation and discussion of their respective environmental impacts. This paper reviews the life cycle assessment studies analyzing the environmental impacts of pallets with the intent of providing insights into the methodological choices made, as well as compiling the inventory data from the studies reviewed. The study is a meta-analysis of eleven scientiﬁc articles, two conference articles, two peer-reviewed reports, and one thesis. The review was implemented to identify the key methodological choices made in those studies, such as their goals, functional units, system boundaries, inventory data, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) procedures, and results. The 16 studies reviewed cumulatively analyzed 43 pallets. Mostly pooled (n = 22/43), block-type (n = 13/43), and wooden (n = 32/43) pallets with dimensions of 1219 mm × 1016 mm or 48 in. × 40 in. (n = 15/43) were studied. Most of the studies represented pallet markets in the United States (n = 9/16). Load-based (e.g., 1000 kg of products delivered), trip-based (e.g., 1000 trips), and pallet-based (e.g., one pallet) functional units were declared. A trip-based functional unit seems the most appropriate for accounting of the function of the pallets, as its purpose is to carry goods and facilitate the transportation of cargo. A signiﬁcant amount of primary inventory data on the production and repair of wooden and plastic pallets are available, yet there are signiﬁcant variations in the data. Data on pallets made of wood–polymer composites was largely missing.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are often considered a potential solution to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originating from personal transport vehicles, but this has also been questioned due to their high production emissions. In this study, we performed an extensive literature review of existing EV life-cycle assessments (LCAs) and a meta-analysis of the studies in the review, extracting life-cycle GHG emission data combined with a standardized methodology for estimating GHG electrical grid intensities across the European Economic Area (EEA), which were used to estimate a set of environmental breakeven points for each EEA country. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to provide sensitivity analysis. The results of the review suggest a need for greater methodological and data transparency within EV LCA research. The meta-analysis found a subset of countries across the EEA where there is a potential that EVs could lead to greater life-cycle GHG emissions than a comparable diesel counterpart. A policy discussion highlights how EV policies in countries with contrasting GHG electric grid intensities may not reﬂect the current techno-environmental reality. This paper emphasizes the importance for researchers to accurately depict life-cycle vehicle emissions and the need for EEA countries to enact policies corresponding to their respective contextual conditions to avoid potentially enacting policies that could lead to greater GHG emissions.},

The goal of this article is to determine if resource use aspects are adequately reflected within life cycle assessment (LCA) case studies of electric vehicles (EV). Overall, 103 LCA studies on electric vehicles from 2009 to 2018 are evaluated regarding their objective, scope, considered impact categories, and assessment methods—with a focus on resource depletion and criticality. The performed analysis shows that only 24 out of 76 EV LCA and 10 out of 27 battery LCA address the issue of resources. The majority of the studies apply one of these methods: CML‐IA, ReCiPe, or Eco‐Indicator 99. In most studies, EV show higher results for mineral and metal resource depletion than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). The batteries analysis shows that lithium, manganese, copper, and nickel are responsible for the highest burdens. Only few publications approach resource criticality. Although this topic is a serious concern for future mobility, it is currently not comprehensively and consistently considered within LCA studies of electric vehicles. Criticality should be included in the analyses in order to derive results on the potential risks associated with certain resources.},

In this analysis, we calculated the energy consumed and air emissions generated when recovering LiMn2O4, aluminum, and copper in three recycling processes (hydrometallurgical, intermediate physical, and direct physical recycling) and examined the eﬀect(s) of closed-loop recycling on environmental impacts of battery production. We aimed to develop a U.S.-speciﬁc analysis of lithiumion battery production and in particular sought to resolve literature discrepancies concerning energy consumed during battery assembly. Our analysis takes a process-level (versus a top-down) approach. For a battery used in a BEV, we estimated cradle-to-gate energy and GHG emissions of 75 MJ/kg battery and 5.1 kg CO2e/kg battery, respectively. Battery assembly consumes only 6\% of this total energy. These results are signiﬁcantly less than reported in studies that take a top-down approach. We further estimate that direct physical recycling of LiMn2O4, aluminum, and copper in a closedloop scenario can reduce energy consumption during material production by up to 48\%.},

	abstract = {An attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) estimates what share of the global environmental burdens belongs to a product. A consequential LCA (CLCA) gives an estimate of how the global environmental burdens are affected by the production and use of the product. The distinction arose to resolve debates on what input data to use in an LCA and how to deal with allocation problems. An ALCA is based on average data, and allocation is performed by partitioning environmental burdens of a process between the life cycles served by this process. A CLCA ideally uses marginal data in many parts of the life cycle and avoids allocation through system expansion. This chapter aims to discuss and clarify the key concepts. It also discusses pros and cons of different methodological options, based on criteria derived from the starting point that environmental systems analysis should contribute to reducing the negative environmental impacts of humankind or at least reduce the impacts per functional unit: the method should be feasible and generate results that are accurate, comprehensible, inspiring, and robust. The CLCA is more accurate, but ALCA has other advantages. The decision to make an ALCA or a CLCA should ideally be taken by the LCA practitioner after discussions with the client and possibly with other stakeholders and colleagues.},

For the Inventory Analysis, this distinction is relevant when discussing system boundaries, data collection, and allocation. Also highlighted are developments concerning databases and Input–Output and hybrid LCA. In the sections on Life Cycle Impact Assessment we discuss the characteristics of the modelling as well as some recent developments for speciﬁc impact categories and weighting.

From an energy perspective, glass fiber composites and high-strength steel beams performed best. This paper also presents a set of life cycle energy terms designed to clearly distinguish between energy consumption occurring during different phases of a product’s life cycle. In addition, this paper compares the results of the LCEA method to those of other energy analyses and demonstrates how different methods of varying thoroughness can result in different material selections.

	abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles pose great potentials to de-carbonize the transportation sector. To jump-start their market deployment, regulations in China, the U.S., and the European Union provide preferential treatments, including counting a single plug-in electric vehicle with multipliers (super-credits) in calculating sales-averaged emissions (regulation dilution effect) and considering zero emissions for the electric mileage by omitting elec­ tricity generation emissions (regulation leakage effect). This study quantifies greenhouse gas emission increases due to these two effects in the three markets. We show that plug-in electric vehicles sold in 2012–2025 in the three markets will result in greenhouse gas emission increases of more than 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through 2050 relative to the case without the two effects. The increase is 671, 280, and 143 million tonnes in China, the U.S., and the EU, respectively. The dilution effect causes an increase of 615 million tonnes, and the leakage effect 479 million tonnes. As the plug-in electric vehicle market grows, their super-credits should be gradually withdrawn, and well-to-wheels emissions need to be considered to achieve holistic greenhouse gas emission reductions. Future regulations should be carefully designed to incentivize new technologies while mitigating the risk of increasing emissions elsewhere so that the intent of environmental regulations is not compromised.},

	abstract = {Many advanced vehicle technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), are gaining attention throughout the World due to their capability to improve fuel efficiencies and emissions. When evaluating the operational successes of these new fuel-efficient vehicles, it is essential to consider energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the entire lifetimes of the vehicles, which are comprised of two independent cycles: a fuel cycle and a vehicle cycle. This paper intends to contribute to the assessment of the environmental impacts from the alternative technologies throughout the lifetimes of various advanced vehicles through objective comparisons. The methodology was applied to six commercial vehicles that are available in the U.S. and that have similar dimensions and performances. We also investigated the shifts in energy consumption and emissions through the use of electricity and drivers’ behavior regarding the frequencies of battery recharging for EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This study thus gives insight into the impacts of the electricity grid on the total energy cycle of a vehicle lifetime. In addition, the total ownership costs of the selected vehicles were examined, including considerations of the fluctuating gasoline prices. The cost analysis provides a resource for drivers to identify optimal choices for their driving circumstances.},

            Modern life is enabled by the use of materials in its technologies. Over time, these technologies have used a larger and more diverse array of materials. Elemental life cycle analyses yield an understanding of these materials, and a definite concern that arises is that of possible scarcity of some of the elements as their use increases. We studied substitution potential for 62 different metals in their major uses. For a dozen different metals, the potential substitutes for their major uses are either inadequate or appear not to exist at all. Further, for not 1 of the 62 metals are exemplary substitutes available for all major uses.
          , 
            It is indisputable that modern life is enabled by the use of materials in its technologies. Those technologies do many things very well, largely because each material is used for purposes to which it is exquisitely fitted. The result over time has been a steady increase in product performance. We show that this materials complexity has markedly increased in the past half-century and that elemental life cycle analyses characterize rates of recycling and loss. A further concern is that of possible scarcity of some of the elements as their use increases. Should materials availability constraints occur, the use of substitute materials comes to mind. We studied substitution potential by generating a comprehensive summary of potential substitutes for 62 different metals in all their major uses and of the performance of the substitutes in those applications. As we show herein, for a dozen different metals, the potential substitutes for their major uses are either inadequate or appear not to exist at all. Further, for not 1 of the 62 metals are exemplary substitutes available for all major uses. This situation largely decouples materials substitution from price, thereby forcing material design changes to be primarily transformative rather than incremental. As wealth and population increase worldwide in the next few decades, scientists will be increasingly challenged to maintain and improve product utility by designing new and better materials, but doing so under potential constraints in resource availability.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) coupled with low-carbon electricity sources offer the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to tailpipe emissions from personal transportation. In considering these beneﬁts, it is important to address concerns of problemshifting. In addition, while many studies have focused on the use phase in comparing transportation options, vehicle production is also signiﬁcant when comparing conventional and EVs. We develop and provide a transparent life cycle inventory of conventional and electric vehicles and apply our inventory to assess conventional and EVs over a range of impact categories. We ﬁnd that EVs powered by the present European electricity mix offer a 10\% to 24\% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km. However, EVs exhibit the potential for signiﬁcant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the vehicle supply chain. Results are sensitive to assumptions regarding electricity source, use phase energy consumption, vehicle lifetime, and battery replacement schedules. Because production impacts are more signiﬁcant for EVs than conventional vehicles, assuming a vehicle lifetime of 200,000 km exaggerates the GWP beneﬁts of EVs to 27\% to 29\% relative to gasoline vehicles or 17\% to 20\% relative to diesel. An assumption of 100,000 km decreases the beneﬁt of EVs to 9\% to 14\% with respect to gasoline vehicles and results in impacts indistinguishable from those of a diesel vehicle. Improving the environmental proﬁle of EVs requires engagement around reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) methods and tools are increasingly being taught in university courses. Students are learning the concepts and applications of process-based LCA, input−output-based LCA, and hybrid methods. Here, we describe a classroom simulation to introduce students to an economic input−output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) method. The simulation uses a simpliﬁed four-industry economy with eight transactions among the industries. Production functions for the transactions and waste generation amounts are provided for each industry. Students represent an industry and receive and issue purchase orders for materials to simulate the actual purchases of materials within the economy. Students then compare the simulation to mathematical representations of the model. Finally, students view an online EIO-LCA tool (www.eiolca.net) and use the tool to compare different products. The simulation has been used successfully with a wide range of students to facilitate conceptual understanding of one EIO-LCA method.},

In this paper, the CO2 emissions of conventional gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles (ICV) were compared with mainstream alternative powertrain technologies, namely battery electric vehicles (BEV), using life-cycle assessment (LCA). In most of the current studies, CO2 emissions were calculated assuming that the region where the vehicles were used, the lifetime driving distance in that region and the CO2 emission from the battery production were ﬁxed. However, in this paper, the life cycle CO2 emissions in each region were calculated taking into consideration the vehicle’s lifetime driving distance in each region and the deviations in CO2 emissions for battery production. For this paper, the US, European Union (EU), Japan, China, and Australia were selected as the reference regions for vehicle operation. The calculated results showed that CO2 emission from the assembly of BEV was larger than that of ICV due to the added CO2 emissions from battery production. However, in regions where renewable energy sources and low CO2 emitting forms of electric power generation are widely used, as vehicle lifetime driving distance increase, the total operating CO2 emissions of BEV become less than that of ICV. But for BEV, the CO2 emissions for replacing the battery with a new one should be added when the lifetime driving distance is over 160,000 km. Moreover, it was shown that the life cycle CO2 emission of ICV was apt to be smaller than that of BEV when the CO2 emissions for battery production were very large.},

	abstract = {This study examines the vehicle-cycle and vehicle total life-cycle impacts of substituting lightweight materials into vehicles. We determine part-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emission ratios by collecting material substitution data and evaluating that alongside known mass-based GHG ratios (using and updating Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model) associated with material pair substitutions. Several vehicle parts are lightweighted via material substitution, using substitution ratios from a U.S. Department of Energy report, to determine GHG emissions. We then examine fuelcycle GHG reductions from lightweighting. The fuel reduction value methodology is applied using FRV estimates of 0.15− 0.25, and 0.25−0.5 L/(100km·100 kg), with and without powertrain adjustments, respectively. GHG breakeven values are derived for both driving distance and material substitution ratio. While material substitution can reduce vehicle weight, it often increases vehicle-cycle GHGs. It is likely that replacing steel (the dominant vehicle material) with wrought aluminum, carbon ﬁber reinforced plastic (CRFP), or magnesium will increase vehiclecycle GHGs. However, lifetime fuel economy beneﬁts often outweigh the vehicle-cycle, resulting in a net total life-cycle GHG beneﬁt. This is the case for steel replaced by wrought aluminum in all assumed cases, and for CFRP and magnesium except for high substitution ratio and low FRV.},

Home construction and maintenance materials and appliances were inventoried totaling 306 metric tons.The use phase accounted for 91\% of the total life-cycle energy consumption over a 50year home life. A functionally equivalent energy-efficient house (EEH) was modeled that incorporated 11 energy efficiency strategies.These strategies led to a dramatic reduction in the EEH total life-cycle energy; 6,400 GJ for the EEH compared to 16,000 GJ for the SH. For energy-efficient homes, embodied energy of materials is important; pre-use energy accounted for 26\% of life-cycle energy.The discounted (4\%) life-cycle cost, consisting of mortgage, energy, maintenance, and improvement payments varied between \$426,700 and \$454,300 for a SH using four energy price forecast scenarios. In the case of the EEH, energy cost savings were offset by higher mortgage costs, resulting in total life-cycle cost between \$434,100 and \$443,200. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions were 1,010 metric tons CO2 equivalent for an SH and 370 metric tons for an EEH.},

Since “scholarly bullshit” articles engage with the latest academic buzzwords, they also tend to accumulate significant citations and are thus welcomed by many journal editors.

LCT is not a simple concept and should be connected with daily behaviors; it is important to learn LCT not only in primary but also in higher education. Many previous studies suggested that active learning and games can increase the effectiveness of the learning. Against this backdrop, we developed a board game for learning LCT and investigated the effectiveness through a trial with university students. The board game covers key issues, such as power supply conﬁguration, fuel efﬁciency, CO2 emissions associated with production, operational condition and efﬁciency, sharing activities, one-way vs. durable products, and so on. Participants completed surveys to evaluate the LCT knowledge they acquired and the game before and after playing. The results showed that their LCT knowledge signiﬁcantly increased, and was greater in the group with lower LCT knowledge before the game. The participants positively evaluated the game regarding satisfaction and extension to daily life. The positive evaluations were not directly correlated with the increase in LCT knowledge in the group with higher LCT knowledge before the game, whereas satisfaction with the game had a positive inﬂuence on the increase in LCT knowledge in the group with lower LCT knowledge before the game. Implications for improvement, such as combining the game with post-learning activities and means of showing value, were also discussed.},

The pull-off strength obtained using this ﬁeld-testing method may be affected by two major factors: the structure's cross-sectional thickness and tapering near repair edges. This paper aims to investigate and quantify the effects of these two parameters on the pull-off strength, through a combination of experimental testing and computational modelling. By subjecting scarf joints of varying angles to tensile loading, ﬁlm adhesive FM300 was found to obey the modiﬁed Drücker–Prager/cap plasticity criterion. With these data as inputs to a ﬁnite element model and a failure criterion that deﬁnes ﬁnal fracture as when the maximum strain at a characteristic distance reaches the adhesive's failure strain, strength predictions of PATTI tests were carried out, with results being compared to experimental data. The results show that the modiﬁed Drücker–Prager/cap plasticity model gives better prediction than the von Mises yield criterion, with the characteristic distance being determined by an inverse method using test results pertinent to tensile butt joints.},

Previous studies of the program’s environmental impact have focused mainly on the effect of improved fuel economy, and the resulting reductions in fuel use and emissions during the vehicle use phase. We propose and apply a method for analyzing the net effect of CARS on greenhouse gas emissions from a full vehicle life cycle perspective, including the impact of premature production and retirement of vehicles. We ﬁnd that CARS had a one-time effect of preventing 4.4 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, about 0.4\% of US annual light-duty vehicle emissions. Of these, 3.7 million metric tons are avoided during the period of the expected remaining life of the inefﬁcient ‘clunkers’. 1.5 million metric tons are avoided as consumers purchase vehicles that are more efﬁcient than their next replacement vehicle would otherwise have been. An additional 0.8 million metric tons are emitted as a result of premature manufacturing and disposal of vehicles. These results are sensitive to the remaining lifetime of the ‘clunkers’ and to the fuel economy of new vehicles in the absence of CARS, suggesting important considerations for policymakers deliberating on the use of accelerated vehicle retirement programs as a part of the greenhouse gas emissions policy.},

	abstract = {The literature analyzing the fuel saving, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and ownership cost impacts of lightweighting vehicles with diﬀerent powertrains is reviewed. Vehicles with lower powertrain eﬃciencies have higher fuel consumption. Thus, fuel savings from lightweighting internal combustion engine vehicles can be higher than those of hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. However, the impact of fuel savings on life cycle costs and GHG emissions depends on fuel prices, fuel carbon intensities and fuel storage requirements. Battery electric vehicle fuel savings enable reduction of battery size without sacriﬁcing driving range. This reduces the battery production cost and mass, the latter results in further fuel savings. The carbon intensity of electricity varies widely and is a major source of uncertainty when evaluating the beneﬁts of fuel savings. Hybrid electric vehicles use gasoline more eﬃciently than internal combustion engine vehicles and do not require large plug-in batteries. Therefore, the beneﬁts of lightweighting depend on the vehicle powertrain. We discuss the value proposition of the use of lightweight materials and alternative powertrains. Future assessments of the beneﬁts of vehicle lightweighting should capture the unique characteristics of emerging vehicle powertrains.},

Therefore, to make the results reliable, consideration of these uncertainties is imperative. Among the various classiﬁcations, parameter, scenario, and model uncertainty are widely reported and well-acknowledged uncertainty types in LCA. There are several techniques available to deal with these uncertainties; however, each strategy has its own pros and cons. Furthermore, just a few of the methods have been included in LCA software, which restricts their potential for wider application in LCA research. This paper offers a comprehensive framework that concurrently considers parameter, scenario, and model uncertainty. Moreover, practitioners may select multiple alternatives depending on their needs and available resources. Based on the availability of time, resources, and technical expertise three levels—basic, intermediate, and advanced—are suggested for uncertainty treatment. A qualitative method, including local sensitivity analysis, is part of the basic approach. Monte Carlo sampling and local sensitivity analysis, both of which are accessible in LCA software, are suggested at the intermediate level. Advanced sampling methods (such as Latin hypercube or Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling) with global sensitivity analysis are proposed for the advanced level.},

	abstract = {For sustainable design, technology developers need to consider not only technical and economic aspects but also potential environmental impacts while developing new technologies. Techno economic analysis (TEA) evaluates the technical performance and economic feasibility of a technology. Life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates the potential environmental impacts associated with a product system throughout its life cycle from raw material extraction to disposal. Generally, TEA and LCA performed separately for technology assessment. Understanding of the trade-off between economic and environmental performance is crucial for sustainable process design, which is not fully available if TEA and LCA is performed separately. In contrast, integration of TEA and LCA enables systematic analysis of the relationships between technical, economic, and environmental performance and provides more information to technology developers for trade-off analysis. Integrated TEA-LCA tool can also reduce inconsistency between system boundaries, functional units, and assumptions that can arise from using standalone TEA and LCA findings in decision making. There is also growing interest of prospective application of integrated TEA-LCA tool to evaluate emerging technologies at early technology readiness level (TRL). Integration of TEA and LCA is still an evolving area and requires further exploration to develop a consistent methodological guideline. The goal of this study is to review the current state-of-the-art in TEA and LCA to identify the meth­ odological challenges of TEA-LCA integration approaches. This study also identifies major challenges to perform integrated TEA-LCA analysis of emerging technologies at low TRLs. Lack of consistent methodological guidelines and compatible software tools, inconsistent system boundary and functional unit selection, limited data avail­ ability and uncertainty are key methodological challenges for integration of LCA and TEA. Future research should focus on developing integrated TEA-LCA tool, formulating approach to incorporate optimization method with integrated TEA-LCA tool, and developing strategy of proper communication of results from integrated LCATEA tool to broad range of stakeholders.},

	abstract = {This study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of three batteries for plug-in hybrid and full performance battery electric vehicles. A transparent life cycle inventory (LCI) was compiled in a component-wise manner for nickel metal hydride (NiMH), nickel cobalt manganese lithium-ion (NCM), and iron phosphate lithium-ion (LFP) batteries. The battery systems were investigated with a functional unit based on energy storage, and environmental impacts were analyzed using midpoint indicators. On a per-storage basis, the NiMH technology was found to have the highest environmental impact, followed by NCM and then LFP, for all categories considered except ozone depletion potential. We found higher life cycle global warming emissions than have been previously reported. Detailed contribution and structural path analyses allowed for the identiﬁcation of the diﬀerent processes and value-chains most directly responsible for these emissions. This article contributes a public and detailed inventory, which can be easily be adapted to any powertrain, along with readily usable environmental performance assessments.},

	abstract = {Light-weighting of passenger cars using high-strength steel or aluminum is a common emissions mitigation strategy. We provide a ﬁrst estimate of the global impact of light-weighting by material substitution on GHG emissions from passenger cars and the steel and aluminum industries until 2050. We develop a dynamic stock model of the global car ﬂeet and combine it with a dynamic MFA of the associated steel, aluminum, and energy supply industries. We propose four scenarios for substitution of conventional steel with high-strength steel and aluminum at diﬀerent rates over the period 2010−2050. We show that light-weighting of passenger cars can become a “gigaton solution”: Between 2010 and 2050, persistent light-weighting of passenger cars can, under optimal conditions, lead to cumulative GHG emissions savings of 9−18 gigatons CO2-eq compared to development business-as-usual. Annual savings can be up to 1 gigaton per year. After 2030, enhanced material recycling can lead to further reductions: closed-loop metal recycling in the automotive sector may reduce cumulative emissions by another 4−6 gigatons CO2-eq. The eﬀectiveness of emissions mitigation by material substitution signiﬁcantly depends on how the recycling system evolves. At present, policies focusing on tailpipe emissions and life cycle assessments of individual cars do not consider this important eﬀect.},

However, limited data, uncertain functionality, scale up issues and uncertainties make it very challenging for the standard LCA guidelines to evaluate emerging technologies and requires methodological advances in the current LCA framework. In this paper, we review published literature to identify major methodological challenges and key research efforts to resolve these issues with a focus on recent developments in five major areas: cross-study comparability, data availability and quality, scale-up issues, uncertainty and uncertainty communication, and assessment time. We also provide a number of recommendations for future research to support the evaluation of emerging technologies at low technology readiness level: (1) the development of a consistent framework and reporting methods for LCA of emerging technologies; (2) the integration of other tools with LCA, such as multicriteria decision analysis, risk analysis, techno-economic analysis; and (3) the development of a data repository for emerging materials, processes, and technologies.},

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes enable the manufacture of optimized parts with minimal material requirements, and the products manufactured using the AM processes have the potential to reduce energy over a product’s entire lifespan. Typically, engineering analyses of AM focus on the manufacturing phase, but when assessing the life cycle energy of an additively manufactured product, it is vital to consider the material, manufacture, freight and distribution, use, and the disposal phases. Although AM processes may use significantly more energy than conventional processes per unit mass of material processed, parts with optimized shapes and geometric features can yield significant weight savings. For example, in aircraft parts, the primary environmental and energy efficiency benefit from lighter, optimized parts is the fuel savings realized during the use phase. Hence, there is a need for a consistent methodology to calculate life cycle energy consumption and savings attributable to parts and products additively manufactured. An AM methodology and associated tool were developed to enable estimates of life cycle energy consumption and savings.},

	abstract = {Electric mobility is a trending topic around the world, and many countries are supporting electric vehicle technologies to reduce environmental impacts from transportation such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in cities. While such environmental impacts are widely studied in the literature, there is not much emphasis on a comprehensive sustainability assessment of these vehicle technologies, encompassing the three pillars of sustainability as the environment, society, and economy. In this study, we presented a novel comprehensive life cycle sustainability assessment for four different support utility electric vehicle technologies, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and full battery electric vehicles. A hybrid multi-regional input-output based life cycle sustainability assessment model is developed to quantify fourteen sustainability indicators representing the three pillars of sustainability. As a case study, we studied the impacts for Qatar, a country where 100\% of electricity generation is from natural gas and have a very unique supply-chain, mainly due to a wide range of exported products and services. The analysis results showed that all-electric vehicle types have significant potential to lower global warming potential, air pollution, and photochemical oxidant formation. A great majority (above 90\%) of the emissions occurs within the region boundaries of Qatar. In the social indicators, internal combustion vehicles performed better than all other electric vehicles in terms of employment generation, compensation of employees, and taxes. The results highlighted that adoption of electric vehicle alternatives doesn't favor macro-economic indicators and they have slightly less for a life-cycle cost. The proposed assessment methodology can be useful for a comprehensive regionalized life cycle sustainability assessment of alternative vehicle technologies and developing regionalized sustainable transportation policies worldwide.},

	abstract = {The growth of vehicle sales and use world-wide requires the consumption of significant quantities of energy and materials. Advanced propulsion systems and electric drive vehicles have substantially different characteristics and impacts. For a comprehensive comparison of advanced and traditional light duty vehicles, a model is developed that integrates external costs, including emissions and time losses, with societal and consumer life cycle costs. Life cycle emissions and time losses are converted into costs for seven urban light duty vehicles. The results, which are based on vehicle technology characteristics and transportation impacts on environment, facilitate vehicle comparisons and support policy making in transportation. More sustainable urban transportation can be achieved in the short term by promoting policies that increase vehicle occupancy. In the intermediate term, more sustainable urban transportation can be achieved by increasing the share of hybrid vehicles in traffic. In the long term, more sustainable urban transportation can be achieved with the widespread use of electric vehicles. A sensitivity analysis of life cost results revealed that vehicle costs change significantly for different geographical areas depending on vehicle taxation, and the pricing of gasoline, electric power and pollution. Current practices in carbon and air quality pricing favor oil and coal based technologies. However, increasing the cost of electricity from coal and other fossil fuels would increase the variable cost for electric vehicles, and would favor the variable cost of hybrid vehicles.},

	abstract = {In the early phases of product development, it is important to both reduce costs and improve a product's sustainability performance. Insufﬁcient data are available on the costs and sustainability aspects of innovative concepts such as automotive lightweight design, which require the application of new materials and processes. The lack of information and high degree of uncertainty hinder the use of traditional sustainability evaluation tools such as Life Cycle Assessment during these early phases. Tools used in ecodesign and sustainable design have disadvantages since they either focus on only one sustainability dimension, require quantitative data about materials and processes, or cannot be applied by designers and engineers. To overcome these disadvantages, a new checklist for Sustainable Product Development (CSPD) was developed in close collaboration with practitioners. The CSPD allows the qualitative assessment of environmental, economic and social aspects during the early phases of product development while considering a full life cycle perspective. It provides the methodological foundation for an iterative process, in which improvement tasks related to sustainability are deﬁned that must be completed by the engineers. The applicability of the CSPD with reference to a wide range of technologies was evaluated and tested in a case study that included nine automotive lightweight technologies. This case study revealed that the developed tool helped designers and engineers assess and improve the sustainability performance of a technology and that it stimulated processes of collaboration and information exchange within and between organizations.},

	abstract = {The transportation and electricity sectors are in the midst of leading changes in the endeavor to mitigate climate change and air pollution issues. In future years, traditional fossil-fuelled vehicles are estimated to be substituted with electric vehicles (EVs), resulting in higher electricity demand from the transport sector. Meanwhile, the electricity sector is transforming due to policies to adopt renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, and hydropower in the future. However, there are still societal concerns regarding the environmental benefits of these vehicle technologies and how new energy options and vehicles benefit the 2050 HK Carbon Neutral Plan. To address these concerns, this paper aims to analyse the environmental burdens of current (2019) and future (2050) vehicle scenarios in Hong Kong using a life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA was performed for internal combustion vehicles (ICEVs) fuelled by diesel and petrol and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and EVs with future electricity energy mix scenarios (2025–2050). The results revealed that EVs with the 2050 HK electricity mix are an optimal choice and have the least environmental impact in selected impact categories. Additionally, PHEV with diesel were the second most optimal choice to reduce the environmental impacts in current scenarios. In contrast, the petrol ICEV has the utmost environmental impacts in all damage category results. The study shows that clean energy could decrease the environmental impact and mitigate climate change in Hong Kong.},

	abstract = {We have assembled extensive information on the cradle-to-gate environmental burdens of 63 metals in their major use forms, and illustrated the interconnectedness of metal production systems. Related cumulative energy use, global warming potential, human health implications and ecosystem damage are estimated by metal life cycle stage (i.e., mining, purification, and refining). For some elements, these are the first life cycle estimates of environmental impacts reported in the literature. We show that, if compared on a per kilogram basis, the platinum group metals and gold display the highest environmental burdens, while many of the major industrial metals (e.g., iron, manganese, titanium) are found at the lower end of the environmental impacts scale. If compared on the basis of their global annual production in 2008, iron and aluminum display the largest impacts, and thallium and tellurium the lowest. With the exception of a few metals, environmental impacts of the majority of elements are dominated by the purification and refining stages in which metals are transformed from a concentrate into their metallic form. Out of the 63 metals investigated, 42 metals are obtained as coproducts in multi output processes. We test the sensitivity of varying allocation rationales, in which the environmental burden are allocated to the various metal and mineral products, on the overall results. Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to further investigate the stability of our results. This analysis is the most comprehensive life cycle comparison of metals to date and allows for the first time a complete bottom-up estimate of life cycle impacts of the metals and mining sector globally. We estimate global direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 at 3.4 Gt CO2-eq per year and primary energy use at 49 EJ per year (9.5\% of global use), and report the shares for all metals to both impact categories.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In the past decade, sporadic shortages of metals and metalloids crucial to modern technology have inspired attempts to determine the relative “criticality” of various materials as a guide to materials scientists and product designers. The variety of methodologies that have been used for this purpose have (predictably) resulted in widely varying results, which are therefore of little use. In the present study, we develop a comprehensive, flexible, and transparent approach that we apply to 62 metals and metalloids. We find that the metals of most concern tend to be those with three characteristics: they are available largely or entirely as byproducts, they are used in small quantities for highly specialized applications, and they possess no effective substitutes.

            Imbalances between metal supply and demand, real or anticipated, have inspired the concept of metal criticality. We here characterize the criticality of 62 metals and metalloids in a 3D “criticality space” consisting of supply risk, environmental implications, and vulnerability to supply restriction. Contributing factors that lead to extreme values include high geopolitical concentration of primary production, lack of available suitable substitutes, and political instability. The results show that the limitations for many metals important in emerging electronics (e.g., gallium and selenium) are largely those related to supply risk; those of platinum group metals, gold, and mercury, to environmental implications; and steel alloying elements (e.g., chromium and niobium) as well as elements used in high-temperature alloys (e.g., tungsten and molybdenum), to vulnerability to supply restriction. The metals of most concern tend to be those available largely or entirely as byproducts, used in small quantities for highly specialized applications, and possessing no effective substitutes.},

	abstract = {In addition to increasing interest in the supply risk of minerals produced in China, there is also concern that China's efforts to mitigate its own mineral supply risk—through overseas foreign direct investment—may limit mineral availability for other countries in the short-term (due to production capacity constraints). However, little is publicly known about the quantity of global mineral production that is subject to Chinese ownership influence or how this influence may mitigate China's exposure to mineral commodity supply risk. In this analysis, we estimate China's ownership-share of foreign production for cobalt mine and intermediate materials (in the year 2016), as well as the net import reliance of China's cobalt refinery industry—which is then adjusted to reflect China's ownership share of foreign production. First, we find that China's foreign cobalt ownership is predominantly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the largest source of cobalt mine and intermediate imports for China's growing cobalt refinery industry. Second, overseas foreign direct investment provided China with ownership influence over roughly 29\% of its cobalt mine and intermediate imports in 2016—which may have reduced the supply risk exposure of China's refinery industry from a net import reliance of 97\% (on cobalt mine and intermediate materials) to an adjusted net import reliance of 68\%. Third, China's global production share jumps from 2\% to 14\% (for cobalt mine material) and from 11\% to 33\% (for cobalt intermediate material) when China's ownership-share of foreign production is added to China's domestic production share. Fourth, over time China's foreign direct investment appears to have targeted facilities with progressively larger cobalt production capacities. Finally, China's global production share increases as cobalt material moves downstream (i.e. mine, 14\%; intermediate, 33\%; refined, 50\% in 2016). If a primary motivation of China's Going Out Strategy is to secure natural resources, then China's global production share may be reserved for Chinese manufacturers. As a result, this analysis indicates that—for countries outside China—concerns related to critical mineral availability and supply risk may not be confined to minerals produced in China.},

	abstract = {One possibility for electrification of road transport consists of battery electric vehicles in combination with carbon-free sources of electricity. It is highly likely that lithium-ion batteries will provide the basis for this development. In the present paper, we use a recently developed, semi-quantitative assessment scheme to evaluate the relative supply risks associated with the elements used in the functional materials of six different lithium-ion battery types. Eleven different indicators in four supply risk categories are applied to each element; the weighting of the indicators is determined by external experts within the framework of an Analytic Hierarchy Process. The range of supply risk values on the elemental level is distinctly narrower than in our previous work on photovoltaic materials. The highest values are obtained for lithium and cobalt; the lowest for aluminium and titanium. Copper, iron, nickel, carbon (graphite), manganese and phosphorous form the middle group. We then carry out the assessment of the six battery types, to give comparative supply risks at the technology level. For this purpose the elemental supply risk values are aggregated using four different methods. Due to the small spread at the elemental level the supply risk values in all four aggregation methods also lie in a narrow range. Removing lithium, aluminium and phosphorous from the analysis, which are present in all types of battery, improves the situation. For aggregation with the simple arithmetic mean, an uncertainty analysis shows that only lithium-iron phosphate has a measurably lower supply risk compared to the other battery types. For the “cost-share” aggregation using seven elements, lithium cobalt oxide has a substantially higher supply risk than most other types.},

The Poisson's ratio of the thin ®lm can be determined after the bending and torsional vibration modes are measured. To obtain cantilevers with prismatic cross section, the micromachined beams were fabricated on the (1 1 1) silicon substrate. The primary advantage of this technique is that the error of Poisson's ratio due to the deviation of ®lm thickness can be signi®cantly reduced. In application of this technique, the Poisson's ratio of thermally grown silicon dioxide is measured to be 0:202 Æ 0:021.},

Raman spectroscopic estimators are shown to give a full account of the plastic behavior of silica under pressure. While the permanent densification of silica has been widely discussed in terms of amorphous-amorphous transition, from a plasticity point of view, the evolution of the residual densification with the maximum pressure of a pressure cycle can be discussed as a density hardening phenomenon. In the framework of such a mechanical aging effect, we propose that the glass structure could be labelled by the maximum pressure experienced by the glass and that the saturation of densification could be associated with the densest packing of tetrahedra only linked by their vertices.},

The physical mechanisms that cause CLID are not sufficiently understood to predict the extent to which a contaminant will cause damage. Although standard computational methods can be used to predict the amount of contamination on an optic, the effects of those molecules or particles on laser performance has not been sufficiently quantified. This paper will describe an approach for managing CLID that relies on laboratory studies to understand the relationship between contaminant type or quantity and CLID thresholds. That insight can then be used to guide the definition of cleanliness requirements and the design of material screening tests. Initial efforts to study how mass transport, the movement of contaminants in and out of the laser beam, affects damage rates will be discussed as well.},

A cube corner indentation method was used to measure the fracture toughness of the OSG films, which ranges from 0.01 to 0.05 MPaØm1y2. Film fracture was also observed during superlayer indentation adhesion testing. Interfacial cracks kinked into the film itself, indicating competition between adhesive and cohesive failure mechanisms. Given that the crack propagates through the low-K, critical stress intensities on the order of 0.05 MPaØm1y2 are estimated. This is also consistent with the upper bound calculations of 0.06 MPaØm1y2, based on spontaneous film fracture at a critical film thickness of 3 mm due to tensile residual film stress relief.},

	abstract = {Sacriﬁcial aluminium etching enables micromechanical structures integrated with circuitry to be fabricated using standard IC processes followed by simple post-processing. In this paper, the etching characteristics of CMOS aluminium in four etch solutions are reported. The solutions are (A) a commercially available aluminium etchant, (B) Krumm etch, (C) diluted hydrochloric acid, and (D) diluted hydrochloric acid with hydrogen peroxide. The etching of narrow channels is studied as a function of time and temperature. Initially, the etching process is reaction-rate controlled and then crosses over to a diffusion-controlled regime with reduced etch rate. Underetching distances larger than 250 µm are readily achieved with etchants ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘D’. The commercially available aluminium etchant has a low initial underetch rate of 68 µm h−1 at 50 ◦C but offers best control. The initial etch rate of hydrochloric acid with hydrogen peroxide is 500 µm h−1 at 30 ◦C. However, irregular etch fronts are obtained. Reliable protection of aluminium pads against etchants ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘D’ is guaranteed by Shipley’s photoresist S1828 spun at 3000 rpm and hardbaked at 140 ◦C.},

Thermokinetic data, such as exothermic onset temperature (T0), heat of decomposition (DHd), pressure rise rate (dP/dt), and self-heating rate (dT/dt), were obtained and assessed by the DSC and VSP2 experiments. From the thermal decomposition reaction on various concentrations of H2SO4, the experimental data of T0, DH, dP/dt, and dT/dt were obtained. Comparisons of the reactivity for H2O2 and H2O2 mixed with H2SO4 (lower and higher concentrations) were evaluated to corroborate the decomposition reaction in these systems.},

	abstract = {Stress relief effect is believed to be the main reason why the porous structure ﬁlms have high laser induced damage threshold. But there is little systematic theoretical investigation of this view. This essay adopts spherical coordinate model to calculate the temperature and stress distribution in the ﬁlm and analyzes the local stress redistribution after phase transformation or crush happens. The inﬂuences of porosity and pore radius on stress redistribution have been studied. The results show that: for the case of only local crush occurrence, the changes of porosity and pore radius have little inﬂuence on the stress relief effect. For the ﬁlms with low porosity, the formed thermal stress cannot be alleviated effectively. When local phase transformation happens, the permeation action of high pressure ﬂuid can reduce the local high pressure in the phase transformation zone; on the other hand, it can make the high pressure ﬂuid permeate to ﬁlm's surface and cause surface tensile stress increase. The ﬁnal effect is the competitive result of these two mechanisms. Overall, when the permeation action of phase transformation materials happens, the higher porosity or larger pore radius, the higher capability of ﬁlms to resist laser damage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper presents further studies to determine the interface toughness of low-k ﬁlms (black diamond (BD) ﬁlm) using wedge indentation experiments and analysis. In addition, the eﬀects of ﬁlm thickness on the delamination mode are studied and an analysis methodology is proposed. The curvature of the delamination crack front is measured and compared for the ﬁlms with diﬀerent thicknesses, and this information is used to determine the critical buckling stress and the delamination mode: i.e. with or without buckling. For a thinner ﬁlm with a straight crack front, there is greater likelihood of buckling delamination, while for a thicker ﬁlm with a curved crack front buckling is less likely. Combining these results with those from a previous study, it is shown that the wedge indentation test is capable of accurately measuring the interface toughness of low-k ﬁlms, and a pop-in event in the load–penetration curve can be used as an early indication of interface crack initiation. It is also found that the resistances to the initiation and propagation of the interfacial cracks for the porous methylsilsesquioxane (MSQ) and non-porous BD ﬁlms are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent; this could be due to the fact that in the porous MSQ ﬁlm, molecular bridges might provide an additional mechanism to resist interfacial delamination cracks.},

The theoretical results of electric ﬁeld distributions of the samples were calculate by thin ﬁlm design software (TFCalc). It was found that SiO2 overcoat had improved the LIDT greatly, while MgF2 overcoat had little effect on the LIDT because of its high stress in the HR coatings.

	abstract = {The University of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) has recently completed the construction of the OMEGA EP short-pulse, petawatt laser system. A major structure for OMEGA EP is the grating compressor chamber (GCC). This large (15,750-ft3) vacuum chamber contains numerous optics used in laser-pulse compression of two 40-cm-sq-aperture, IR (1054-nm) laser beams. Critical to this compression, within the GCC, are eight sets (four per beamline) of tiled (e.g., three optical elements precisely held side by side to act as one element) multilayer-dielectric (MLD)-diffraction-grating assemblies (three gratings per assembly) that provide the capability for producing 2.6-kJ output IR energy per beam at 10 ps. The primary requirements for each of the 24 large-aperture (43-cm × 47-cm) gratings are a high diffraction efficiency greater than 95\%, a peak-to-valley wavefront quality of less than λ/4 waves at 1054 nm, and a laser-induced-damage threshold greater than 2.7 J/cm2 at 10-ps pulse width (measured at normal beam incidence). Degradation of grating laser-damage thresholds due to adsorption of contaminants must be prevented to maintain system performance.},

Although well-developed methods can be highly effective, dealing with insulating or ungrounded samples for which high spatial resolution is needed remains a challenge. Examples of the application of methods involving low-energy ion sources and sample thinning using a focused ion beam that can allow high-resolution measurements on a variety of samples are highlighted. The physical bases of newer and traditional methods are simply described along with strengths and limitations of the methods. Summary tables indicate methods that can be applied to most AES spectrometers, methods that require special instrumental capabilities and methods that require special sample preparation or mounting.},

The error associated with a poorly defined contact area has been reduced by more sophisticated modelling. This includes the introduction of the gamma correction factor wJ. Mater. Res. 14 (1999) 2296x, which compensates for the elastic–plastic contact in real materials. Acoustic microscopy can also be used for the measurement of near surface modulus of thin films. However, both techniques are dependent on accurate appraisal of Poisson’s ratio in order to calculate Young’s modulus. Therefore, experimental determination of Young’s modulus by both techniques was compared graphically against Poisson’s ratio. Intersection of the acoustic curve with the nanoindentation curve for fused silica provided an accurate appraisal of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Results for the TiNyNbN multilayer were less conclusive and further investigation on the effect of the substrate on both techniques needs to be performed. ᮊ 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

One finds that for either cohesive or adhesive fracture, crack instability (where the crack has a characteristic dimension, a) is predicted by a general equation of the form acr = k{\textasciitilde}/E-{\textasciitilde} where k =f[geometry and loading] and includes all loading and geometric factors, E and y are Young's modulus and specific fracture energy, respectively, and ac, is the applied load at incipient failure.},

A 100 Terawatt laser operating at 400 fs and 1.053 p.m i operational at LLNL. and a 1000 Terawatt (Petawatt) laser will come online in early I 996. These lasers use large-aperture (40 cm and 94 cm diameter, respectively) diffraction gratings to compress the amplified laser pulse. At present, holographically produced, gold overcoated photoresist gratings are used: these gratings represent the fuse in the laser chain. Higher laser damage thresholds and higher diffraction efficiencies are theoretically possible with multilayer dielectic gratings (MDGs). A number ofdesign parameters regarding both the multilayer stack and the etched grating structure can be optimized to maximize the laser damage threshold and also improve the processing latitude for the interference lithography and reactive ion etching steps used during manufacture of these gratings. This paper presents model predictions for the behavior of hafiialsilica MDG's both during processing and in operation. and presents expeiiinental data on the diffraction efficiency and short-pulse laser damage threshold for optimized witness gratings.},

However, they suffer from process-induced defects that inhibit their stability in aqueous and hygroscopic environments. We explore the water stability of ALD deposited alumina barrier ﬁlms capped with nickel oxide (NiOx) and titanium oxide (TiOx) thin ﬁlms deposited through e-beam or ALD deposition. The performance of the barriers was evaluated by measuring their ability to protect zinc oxide (ZnO) thin ﬁlm sensors immersed in deionized (DI) water. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the composition of the barrier ﬁlms with the various capping layers. The characteristic photoluminescence (PL) peak for the ZnO sensor was used as a marker to study changes in peak intensity due to degradation of the barrier ﬁlms as a function of water immersion time. The TiOx capped ﬁlms showed remarkable stability when immersed in DI water for 10 days. These results show that TiOx capping layers can offer superior protection to mitigate the water degradation of ALD alumina barrier ﬁlms. Such composite laminates will enable a wider range of applications for ALD deposited alumina barrier ﬁlms including aqueous environments.},

	abstract = {Laser induced damage, that initiates catastrophic fracture, has been observed in large (up to 61-cm diameter), fused silica lenses that also serve as vacuum barriers in high-fluence positions on the Nova and Beamlet lasers. In nearly all cases damage occurs on the vacuum (tensile) side of the lens. The damage can lead to catastrophic crack growth if the flaw (damage) size exceeds the critical flaw size for 5i02. If the elastic stored energy in the lens is high enough, the lens will fracture into many pieces resulting in an implosion. The consequences of such an implosion can be severe, particularly for large vacuum systems. Three parameters control the degree of fracture in the vacuum barrier window: 1) the elastic stored energy (i.e. tensile stress) 2) the ratio of the window thickness to flaw depth and 3) secondary crack propagation. Fracture experiments have been carried out on 15-cm diameter fused silica windows that contain surface flaws caused by laser damage. The results of these experiments, combined with data from window failures on Beamlet and Nova have been used to develop design criteria for a "fail-safe" lens (that is, a lens that may catastrophically fracture but will not implode). Specifically the window must be made thick enough such that the peak tensile stress is less than 500 psi (3.4 MPa) and the corresponding ratio of the thickness to critical flaw size is less that 6. Under these conditions a properly mounted window, upon failure, will break into only two pieces and will not implode. One caveat to these design criteria is that the air leak through the window fracture and into the vacuum must be rapid enough too reduce the load on the window before secondary crack growth occurs. Finite element stress calculations of a window before and immediately following fracture into two pieces show that the elastic stored energy is redistributed if the fragments "lock" in place and thereby bridge the opening. In such cases, the peak stresses at the flaw site can increase leading to further (i.e. secondary) crack growth.},

	abstract = {Indentation is an important method for the determination of mechanical properties of surfaces and thin ﬁlms. It is well known that the measurement results from thin layers are strongly inﬂuenced by the substrate properties. For hardness measurements it is frequently quoted that the indentation depth should be less than one-tenth of the ﬁlm thickness Ž1r10th rule.. This rule is often not practicable for thickness values below 1 ␮m. Therefore a correction method is required that allows the separation of substrate and ﬁlm properties from the load-depth data. Moreover, the calculation is complicated if plastic deformation occurs. The use of a spherical indenter allows one to remain completely within the elastic range if the indenter radius is large enough and the load is low enough. In this case a novel analytical solution for the elastic deformation of a ﬁlm on a ﬂat substrate can be used to simulate the load-depth data. With this solution the determination of Young’s modulus of thin layers is possible independent of indentation depth and ﬁlm thickness. Measurement data from a UMIS-2000 indentation system for different ﬁlm substrate combinations are compared with theoretical results. It is shown, that a separation of the elastic ﬁlm properties is possible. For metal ﬁlms on Si the load-depth data did not differ from that of uncoated substrates. This can be explained mainly by delamination. ᮊ 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Among them, flat bottom pits (FBP) are particularly interesting because they are surface induced damages not related with preexisting cosmetic defects.

Following this idea, a model of FBP formation is developed in this paper. This model predicts a size dependence of the FBP versus the thickness of the buckled layers; this fact is experimentally confirmed. Two different kinds of FBP have been observed; the second one might be related with the seed of nodular defects.},

The interaction mechanism of the laser light with the coating defects is not understood, however. Historically, laser damage has been associated with peaks in the standingwave electric-field distribution within the multilayer films. In the present work we use a finite-difference timedomain electromagnetic modeling code to study the influence of 3-D nodule defects on the E-field distribution. The coating studied is a dielectric multilayer HR consisting of alternating quarter-wave layers of Hf02 and Si02 at 1.06 tim. The nodule is modeled as a parabolic defect initiated at a spherical seed. The modeling results show that E-field enhancements as large as a factor of 4 can be present at the defects. The enhancement shows a complex dependence on the size, depth and dielectric constant of the seed material. In general, defects initiated by large, shallow seeds produce the largest E-fields. Voids at the nodule boundary influence the E-field distribution, but have a small effect on the peak field.},

            The plane-strain and generalized plane stress problems of two materially dissimilar orthogonal elastic wedges, which are bonded together on one of their faces while arbitrary normal and shearing tractions are prescribed on their remaining faces, are treated within the theory of classical elastostatics. The asymptotic behavior of the solution in the vicinity of the intersection of the bonded and loaded planes is investigated. The stress fields are found to be singular there with singularities of the type r−α, where α depends on the ratio of the two shear moduli and on the two Poisson’s ratios. This dependence is shown graphically for physically relevant values of the elastic constants. The largest value of α for the range of constants considered is 0.311 and occurs when one material is rigid and the other is incompressible.},

The model, which consists of an interface crack between two elastic layers, is loaded by uniform internal pressure. The singular integral equations for the dislocation densities are derived and solved using numerical quadrature and the energy release rate is calculated directly from the dislocation densities. Both the two-dimensional and axisymmetric penny-shaped crack problems are considered, and it is noted that there are significant differences between these two cases. It is found that in some cases crack propagation will not be catastrophic.},

In general, for small absorbers and "instantaneous" energy release, one expects three regions of interest. First is an inner region in which material is subjected to high pressure and temperature, pulverized and ejected. The resultant crater morphology will appear melted. A second region, outside the first, exhibits material removal due to spallation, which occurs when a shock wave is reflected at the free surface. The crater surface in this region will appear fractured. Finally, there is an outermost region where stresses are strong enough to crack material, but not to eject it. These regions are described theoretically and compared to representative observed craters in fused silica.},

The phase mixture changes as function of thickness and deposition process temperature, deduced from SE correspond well to XRD and Angle Resolved (AR)-XPS spectroscopy observations. From the absorption spectra at 4.5 eV, defects such as oxygen vacancies are detected, whereas from XPS spectra the estimation of the O/Hf ratio follows the same trend. Deep UV SE reveals diﬀerences in the dielectric function with orthorhombic/monoclinic phase mixtures essentially with peaks at 7.5 and 8.5 eV. Quantum conﬁnement originated from the grain size of the ﬁlms and the excitonic origin of the 6 eV feature are discussed.},

After a post-deposition thermal annealing, blisters are formed by agglomeration of the implanted gas at the ceramic–metal interface. This method can be used to control the pressure in the blister which eventually may lead to delamination at the periphery of the blister. A microsieve with a regular array of circular holes is used during the implantation to assure the initial blister size. Two different microsieves were employed in this work, with pore diameters of 1.5 and 4.5 Am, respectively. The distance between the centres of neighbour pores is twice the pore diameter. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Scanning Optical Microscopy (CSOM) observations allowed the determination of the blistering parameters such as the radius, the height and the blister volume. From the gas content and these parameters, the work of adhesion or energy release rate can be obtained.},

Four distinct damage morphologies were found: pits, flat bottom pits, scalds, and delaminates. The pits and flat bottom pits ({\textless} 30 jim in diameter) were detected at lower fluences (as low as 5J/cm2). The pits seemed to result from ejection of nodular defects by causing local enhancement of the electric field. Scalds and delaminates could be observed at higher fluences (above 13 J/cm2) and seemed to result from the formation of plasmas on the surface. These damage types often originated at pits and were typically less than 300 pm in diameter; their size increased almost linearly with fluence. Finally, the effects of the damage on the characteristics of the beam (reflectivity degradation and phase modulations) were measured.},

The polarizers were designed to operate at a wavelength of 1064 nm at Brewster's angle (56°). The polarizers were tested with a 3-ns laser pulse at 45°, 56°, and 65° incidence angle in order to vary the electric field distribution in the multilayer, studs' their effects on the damage morphology, and investigate the possible advantages of olT-usc angle laser conditioning. The morphology of the laser-induced damage was characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Four distinct damage morphologies (pit, flat bottom pit, scald, and outer layer delamination) were observed. These damage morphologies were found to depend strongly on the angle of incidence of the laser beam. In particular, massive delaminationobserved at4S°and 56° incidence, did not occur at 65°. Instead, large and deep pits were fixind at 65°. The electric field distribution, the temperature rise and the change in stress in the multilayer vere calculated to attempt to better understand the relationship between damage morphology, electric field peak locations, and maximum thermal stress gradients. The calculations showed a tvo-ftld increase in stress change in the hafnia top layers depending on the incidence angle. The stress gradientin the first hafnia-silicainterface was fcund to be highest for 45°, 56°, and 65°, respectively. Finally, the maximum stress was deeper in the multilayer at 65°. Although the limitationsof such simple thermal mechanical model are obvious, the results can explain that outer layer delamination is more likely at 45° and 56° than 65° and that damage sites are expected to be deeper at 65°.},

	abstract = {Stimuli-responsive gas permeation membranes hold substantial potential for industrial processes as well as in analytical and screening applications. Such “smart” membrane systems, although prevalent in liquid mass-transfer manipulations, have yet to be realized for gas applications. We report our progress in developing gas permeation membranes in which liquid crystalline (LC) phases afford the active region of permeation. To achieve rapid and reversible switching between LC and isotropic permeation states, we harnessed the photomechanical action of mesogenic azobenzene dyes that can produce isothermal nematic-isotropic transitions. Both polymeric and low-molecular-weight LC materials were tested. Three different dye-doped LC mixtures with mesogenic azo dyes were infused into commercially available track-etched porous membranes with regular cylindrical pores (0.4 to 10.0 μm). Photoinduced isothermal phase changes in the imbibed material produced large and fully reversible changes in the permeability of the membrane to nitrogen with 5 s of irradiation at 2 mW/cm2. Using two measurement tools constructed in-house, the permeability of the photoswitched membranes was determined by both variable-pressure and variable-volume methods. Both the LC and photogenerated isotropic states demonstrate a linear permeability/pressure (ideal sorption) relationship, with up to a 16-fold difference in their permeability coefficients. Liquid crystal compositions can be chosen such that the LC phase is more permeable than the isotropic—or vice versa. This approach is the first system offering reversible tunable gas permeation membranes.},

	abstract = {The adhesion of ﬁlms and coatings to rigid substrates is often measured using blister geometries, which are loaded either by an applied pressure or a central shaft. The measurement will be aﬀected if there are residual stresses that make a contribution to the energy release rate. This eﬀect is investigated using analytical solutions based on the principle of virtual displacements. A geometrically nonlinear ﬁnite element analysis is conducted for comparison. Furthermore, the relationships among strain energy release rate, load, deﬂection, and fracture radius are discussed in detail. Both analytical solutions and numerical results reveal that uniform tensile residual stresses reduce a specimenÕs deﬂection if it experiences plate behavior under small loads. However, this eﬀect becomes negligible when membrane stresses induced by the loading become dominant.},

	abstract = {Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is a deterministic method for producing complex optics with figure accuracy {\textless}50 nm and surface roughness {\textless}1 nm. MRF was invented at the Luikov Institute of Heat and Mass Transfer in Minsk, Belarus in the late 1980s by a team led by William Kordonski. When the Soviet Union opened up, New York businessman Lowell Mintz was invited to Minsk in 1990 to explore possibilities for technology transfer. Mintz was told of the potential for MRF, but did not understand whether it had value. Mintz was referred to Harvey Pollicove at the Center for Optics Manufacturing of the University of Rochester. As a result of their conversation, they sent Prof. Steve Jacobs to visit Minsk and evaluate MRF. From Jacobs’ positive findings, and with support from Lowell Mintz, Kordonski and his colleagues were invited in 1993 to work at the Center for Optics Manufacturing with Jacobs and Don Golini to refine MRF technology. A “preprototype” finishing machine was operating by 1994. Prof. Greg Forbes and doctoral student Paul Dumas developed algorithms for deterministic control of MRF. In 1996, Golini recognized the commercial potential of MRF, secured investment capital from Lowell Mintz, and founded QED Technologies. The first commercial MRF machine was unveiled in 1998. It was followed by more advanced models and by groundbreaking subaperture stitching interferometers for metrology. In 2006, QED was acquired by and became a division of Cabot Microelectronics. This paper recounts the history of the development of MRF and the founding of QED Technologies.},

Tin whiskers are a serious reliability issue in microelectronics, as they can cause short circuits and device failure. While it is generally accepted that whiskers grow to relieve compressive stresses, the speciﬁc mechanism for whisker formation is yet unknown. Data are presented to support an interface-transport mechanism for whisker nucleation and growth. This mechanism, involving the formation of a viscous layer at the interface between substrate and coating, could explain the extremely rapid growth of whiskers that has been observed experimentally.

Results indicate that substrate thickness strongly affects the thermal stress response of the thin film material. An oxide coating on a thin substrate generally exhibits either tensile or compressive stresses during elevated temperature processing, depending on the mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between substrate and coating. In the case of a thick substrate, however, the thin film coating is likely to exhibit both compressive and tensile stresses during its processing history. These results suggest that special consideration be paid to geometry in the selection of small-scale witness/test material to model the response of large optics to thermal processing.},

	abstract = {In high power laser system, laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) in optical coating is very important for obtaining high performances. The dependence of LIDT on the pulse duration and the repetition rate are well known phenomena. But recently, LIDT was found to have strong temperature dependences in the bulk, surface of substrates, and in coatings. This temperature dependence of LIDT was carefully measured, and the damage formation model was constructed regarding to this temperature dependence. This paper introduces LFEX laser system for First Ignition scheme in the laser fusion. A large-scale pulse compression chamber was designed and constructed, and segmented grating system has been employed for large-scale pulse compressor. This compressor provided good pulse compression performances, but we observed a heavy oil-contamination of optics in this chamber. We have analyzed contaminants and evaluated the effects of the contamination. We also developed new cleaning methods to remove contamination from the coating, and the quantitative analysis of contamination on LIDT was made. We have investigated the characteristics of LIDT in dielectric coatings under the controlled contamination. LIDT of coating drops to 1/2 in the saturated toluene vapor at room temperature.},

We have developed a short-pulse damage test station for accurate determination of the damage threshold of the optics used on future HEPW lasers. The design and performance of the damage test laser source, based on a highly stable, high-beam-quality optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifier, is presented. Our short-pulse damage measurement methodology and results are discussed. The damage initiation is attributed to multiphoton-induced avalanche ionization, strongly dependent on the electric field enhancement in the grating groove structure and surface defects. Measurement results of the dependence of damage threshold on the pulse width, angular dependence of damage threshold of diffraction gratings, and an investigation of short-pulse conditioning effects are presented. We report record {\textgreater}4 J/cm2 right section surface damage thresholds obtained on multilayer dielectric diffraction gratings at 76.5º incidence angles for 10-ps pulses.},

The advantage of such a cleaning system is the direct installation along the beam line which not only allows a fast and reproducible cleaning of the components without removing them from the beam line, but also allows a preventive treatment of the most sensitive optics from further contamination.},

Laser-induced damage experiment was conducted by the standard one-on-one modes and the damage morphology was detected under scanning electron microscope. LIDT of the samples, which are masked on hafnia and on Chrome, are 3.15 and 4.14 J/cm2, respectively. Damage process corresponding to the two kinds of samples is described in detail by analyzing the relative damage morphology. The explanation of the diﬀerence between the two kinds of samples is given with the analysis of the pollution, which was introduced during the manufacturing process.},

An unusual ripple formation arises under specific laser-fluence conditions and produces a bright diffractive effect. A single irradiation does not produce this morphology, proving that it is a cumulative effect requiring multiple laser shots on a test site. The period of this microstructure is found to be between 2.0 and 2.4 μm. The ripple orientation varies across the test site. Varying several experimental conditions such as pulse length, beam polarization and angle of incidence still produces this periodic microstructure, though not always efficiently. This morphology is not seen on MLD stacks or other homogeneous samples.},

In contrast to plasma ashing, photoresist removal using NMP/ TMAH combined with megasonics showed no carbon depletion and no signiﬁcant change in k-value. Mixing TMAH with NMP enhanced photoresist removal efﬁciency with respect to pure NMP. Photoresist removal using NMP/TMAH resulted in lower low-k capacitance (lower k-value) compared with that of plasma ashing process, due to the removal of the damaged layer generated during plasma etching. As a consequence of the removal of the damaged layer, a CD change was observed. The CD loss was estimated to be about 7 nm for 1\% TMAH, and became negligible for 0.1\% TMAH. Analysis of low-k sidewall using angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that solvent mixture containing TMAH also removed sidewall residues generated by the etch plasma.},

From initial surface preparation through ﬁlm deposition, patterning, etching, residue removal, and metallization, an understanding of surface reactions and interactions is critical to the successful continuous scaling, yield, and reliability of electronic devices. In this review, some of the most important surface reactions that drive the development of microelectronic device fabrication are described. The reactions discussed do not constitute comprehensive coverage of this topic in IC manufacture but have been selected to demonstrate the importance of surface/interface reactions and interactions in the development of new materials, processing sequences, and process integration challenges. Specifically, the review focuses on surface reactions related to surface cleaning/ preparation, semiconductor ﬁlm growth, dielectric ﬁlm growth, metallization, and etching (dry and wet).},

The depth of the damage sites in the two environments was analyzed by Alpha2Step 500 m. The differences between the damage observed in the two environments were discussed based on the temperature distribution, absorption and vacuum gaseous composition measurements and gas pressure inﬂuence analysis. Increased coupling of the plasma shock wave and adsorbing water in the coating layer may be considered as the primary cause of the low LIDT observed in vacuum.},

The selection of the SiO2 material as the top layer of the HR mirror for grating fabrication is beneﬁcial for improving the laser-induced damage threshold of MLD grating as well as minimizing the standing-wave effect in the photoresist during the exposure process. Based on an (HLL)9H design comprising quarter-waves of HfO2 (H) and half-waves of SiO2 (L), we obtain an optimal design of the HR mirror for MLD grating, the SiO2 top layer of which is optimized with a merit function including both the diffraction efﬁciency of the MLD grating and the electric ﬁeld enhancement in the grating. Dependence of the performance of the MLD grating on the fabrication error of the dielectric mirror is analysed in detail. The HR mirror is also fabricated by E-beam evaporation, which shows good spectral characteristics at the exposure wavelength of 413 nm and at the operation wavelength of 1053 nm and an average damage threshold of 10 J cm−2 for a 12 ns pulse.},

Based on a (HLL)9H design comprising of quarter-waves of high-index material and half-waves of low-index material, we obtain an optimum MLD coating meeting these requirements by inserting a matching layer being half a quarter-wave of Al2O3 between the initial design and an optimized HfO2 top layer. The optimized MLD coatings exhibits a low reﬂectance of 0.017\% under photoresist at the exposure angle of 17.88 for 413 nm light and a high reﬂectance of 99.61\% under air at the use angle of 51.28 for 1053 nm light. Numerical calculation of intensity distribution in the photoresist coated on the MLD ﬁlm during exposure shows that standing-wave patterns are greatly minimized and thus simulation proﬁle of photoresist gratings after development demonstrates smoother shapes with lower roughness. Furthermore, a MLD gratings with grooves etched into the top layer of this MLD coating provides a high diffraction efﬁciency of 99.5\% and a low electric ﬁeld enhancement ratio of 1.53.

Results show that domes in the ﬁlm surface are nodular defects. Reliable depth information of nodular-ejection pits is obtained by counting layers from the damage edge. The depth statistical result implies nodular defects in these samples are usually originated from deep seeds. Some process optimizations suggestions are given based on the depth information. A simple tractable method is proposed to determine the functional damage threshold of these HfO2/SiO2 multilayer ﬁlms basing on the damage experiments.},

Regardless of the use, one common requirement for successful application is the accuracy of the inflated surface shape. The work reported here concerns the shape control of an inflated thin circular disk through use of a nonlinear finite element analysis. First, a review of the important associated Hencky problem is given. Then we discuss a shape modification, achieved through enforced boundary displacements, which resulted in moving the inflated shape towards a desired parabolic profile.},

	abstract = {Multilayer-dielectric (MLD) diffraction gratings are used in high-power laser systems to compress laser-energy pulses. The peak power deliverable on target for these short-pulse petawatt class systems is limited by the laser-damage resistance of the optical components in the system, especially the MLD gratings. Recent experiments in our laboratory have shown that vapor treatment of MLD gratings at room temperature with organosilanes such as hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) produces an increase in their damage threshold at 1054 nm (10-ps, 370-µm spot size) as compared to uncoated MLD grating control samples. The 1-on-1 laser-damage threshold of an HMDS-treated grating increased by 4.5\% as compared to the uncoated control sample, while the N-on-1 damage threshold of an MLD grating treated with tetramethyldisilazane increased by 16.5\%. For an MLD grating treated with bis-(trifluoropropyl)tetramethyldisilazane, the N-on-1 and 1-on-1 damage thresholds increased by 4.8\% and 5.3\%, respectively. Such increases in laser-damage threshold are unprecedented and counterintuitive because it is widely believed that the presence of organic materials or coatings on the surfaces of optical substrates will inevitably lead to reduced laser-damage resistance.},

	abstract = {Localized damage repair and polishing of silica-based optics using mid- and far-IR CO2 lasers has been shown to be an effective method for increasing optical damage threshold in the UV. However, it is known that CO2 laser heating of silicate surfaces can lead to a level of residual stress capable of causing critical fracture either during or after laser treatment. Sufficient control of the surface temperature as a function of time and position is therefore required to limit this residual stress to an acceptable level to avoid critical fracture. In this work we present the results of 351 nm, 3ns Gaussian damage growth experiments within regions of varying residual stress caused by prior CO2 laser exposures. Thermally stressed regions were non-destructively characterized using polarimetry and confocal Raman microscopy to measure the stress induced birefringence and fictive temperature respectively. For 1{\textasciitilde}40s square pulse CO2 laser exposures created over 0.5-1.25kW/cm2 with a 1-3mm 1/e2 diameter beam (Tmax{\textasciitilde}1500-3000K), the critical damage site size leading to fracture increases weakly with peak temperature, but shows a stronger dependence on cooling rate, as predicted by finite element hydrodynamics simulations. Confocal micro-Raman was used to probe structural changes to the glass over different thermal histories and indicated a maximum fictive temperature of 1900K for Tmax≥2000K. The effect of cooling rate on fictive temperature caused by CO2 laser heating are consistent with finite element calculations based on a Tool-Narayanaswamy relaxation model.},

In the present work, a combination of acid leaching, acid etching, and confocal time resolved photoluminescence (CTP) microscopy has been used to study laser damage initiation at indentation sites. The combination of localized polishing and variations in indentation loads allows one to isolate and characterize the laser damage susceptibility of densified, plastically flowed and fractured fused silica. The present results suggest that: 1) laser damage initiation and growth are strongly correlated with fracture surfaces, while densified and plastically flowed material is relatively benign, and 2) fracture events result in the formation of an electronically defect rich surface layer which promotes energy transfer from the optical beam to the glass matrix.},

In this paper, we study an alternative design to the classic Multidielectric (MLD) gratings [2] called “mixed metal-multidielectric grating” (MMLD). In this design, the dielectric mirror stack of the MLD grating is replaced by a gold reflective layer covered with a few pairs of HfO2/SiO2 [3]. The number of pairs must be high enough to ensure a sufficient reflection coefficient in order to prevent damage of the gold layer. On the top of the stack, a silica layer is coated to receive the grating. After some considerations on the grating design and optimization, a comparison between MLD and MMLD mirrors is also carried out. We finally detail the measured diffraction efficiencies obtained on MMLD gratings.},

Details of the shape of the grating lines2,3 and the concentration of absorbing impurities on the surface of the grating structures both have strong effects on laser damage threshold. It is known that electric field enhancement in the solid material comprising the grating lines varies directly with the linewidth and inversely with the line height for equivalent diffraction efficiency2,3. Here, we present an overview of laser damage characteristics of MLD gratings, and describe a process for post‐processing ion‐beam etched grating lines using very dilute buffered hydrofluoric acid solutions. This process acts simultaneously to reduce grating linewidth and remove surface contaminants, thereby improving laser damage thresholds through two pathways.},

	abstract = {The effective lifetime of optics in the UV is limited both by laser induced damage and the subsequent growth of laser initiated damage sites. We have measured the growth rate of laser induced damage in fused silica in both air and vacuum. The data shows exponential growth in the lateral size of the damage site with shot number above a threshold fluence. The concurrent growth in depth follows a linear dependence with shot number. The size of the initial damage influences the threshold for growth; the morphology of the initial site depends strongly on the initiating fluence. We have found only a weak dependence on pulse length for growth rate. Low fluence conditioning in air may delay the onset of growth. Most of the work has been on bare substrates but the presence of a sol-gel AR coating has no significant effect.},

	abstract = {Multilayer dielectric (MLD) diffraction gratings are a key component for the construction of high-peak-power, pulsecompressed laser systems. While a great deal of effort has been devoted to the design of optimal grating structures and the etching of these structures into the MLD coating, there has not been the same effort put into the optimization of the MLD coating itself. The primary characteristics of the multilayer that must be considered during design include minimization of the standing wave created in the photoresist because of the reflectivity of the coated optical surface, creation of a sufficiently high reflectivity at the use wavelength and incidence angle in a dry environment, proper balance of the individual layer materials to yield a coating with an overall neutral or slightly compressive stress, and a high laserdamage threshold for the wavelength and pulse duration of use. This work focuses on the modification of a standard MLD mirror, while considering these characteristics, to allow the fabrication of a diffraction grating with higher efficiency and laser-damage threshold than is typically achieved. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the grating structures demonstrate smoother shapes with lower roughness due to the holographic exposure. Damage testing performed at 1053 nm with a pulse width of 10 ps demonstrates the MLD coating has a sufficiently high laser-damage threshold to form the basis of reflection gratings that survive in high-fluence applications.},

A series of hafnium dioxide monolayer films deposited by electron-beam evaporation with varying deposition rates and oxygen backfill pressures were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and refractive index modeling. These exhibit microstructural changes for sufficiently slow deposition rates and high oxygen backfill pressures, resulting in an absence of crystalline inclusions and a lower refractive index. Hafnia monolayers exhibited laser-damage resistance as high as 12 J/cm2 at 351 nm with a 0.5-ns pulse. This process was utilized in the fabrication of reduced electric-field-type multilayer high-reflector coatings. Measured laser-damage thresholds as high as 16.63 J/cm2 were achieved under identical test conditions, an exceptional improvement relative to historical damage thresholds of the order of 3 to 5 J/cm2.},

Hafnia has been shown to be a critical material, however, for use in high-peak-power laser coatings, providing exceptional deposition control and laser-damage resistance. To correct for tensile thin-film stresses in hafnia/silica multilayer coatings, alumina compensation layers were incorporated in the multilayer design. Determination of the stresses resulting from alumina layers in different coating designs has led to the realization of the influence of water diffusion and the diffusion-barrier properties of alumina that must be considered.

In this review, we examine how dierent spectroscopies, in particular X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), have been used to determine the physics and chemistry of a variety of thin ®lms and interfaces commonly found in microelectronic devices. Electron spectroscopies are particularly attractive because the electron escape depths are comparable to the thickness of the ®lms, allowing one to probe the bulk of the ®lm and the interfaces simultaneously. We also give examples of how one can use the maximum-entropy method, a relatively straightforward analysis technique, to derive composition depth pro®les of thin ®lms from angle-resolved XPS data. Two technologically important classes of thin ®lms are discussed. First, we examine thin inorganic ®lms that are important high dielectric constant materials for CMOS devices or DRAM applications. Second, we discuss metal/polymer interfaces that are important in low dielectric constant device packaging. We conclude by discussing future developments and applications.

Various samples were manufactured, damage tested at a pulse duration of 500fs. Damage sites were subsequently observed by means of Nomarski microscopy and white light interferometer microscopy.

	abstract = {Nanosecond-pulse UV-laser-damage initiation in multilayer coatings comprised from metal oxide as a high-index component, and silica oxide as a low-index material, is strongly linked to metal oxide. The nature of the absorbing species and their physical properties remain unknown because of extremely small sizes. Previous experimental evidence provided by high-resolution mapping of damage morphology points to a few-nanometer scale of these absorbers. This work demonstrates submicrometer mapping of 355-nm absorption in HfO2 monolayers using a recently developed photothermal heterodyne imaging technique. Comparison of absorption maps with spatial distribution of UV pulsedlaser–induced damage morphology allows one to better estimate the size and densities of nanoscale absorbing defects in hafnia thin films. Possible defect-formation mechanisms are discussed.},

	abstract = {In order to design composites and laminated materials, it is necessary to understand the issues that govern crack deﬂection and crack penetration at interfaces. Historically, models of crack deﬂection have been developed using either a strength-based or an energy-based fracture criterion. However, in general, crack propagation depends on both strength and toughness. Therefore, in this paper, crack deﬂection has been studied using a cohesive-zone model which incorporates both strength and toughness parameters simultaneously. Under appropriate limiting conditions, this model reproduces earlier results that were based on either strength or energy considerations alone. However, the general model reveals a number of interesting results. Of particular note is the apparent absence of any lower bound for the ratio of the substrate to interface toughness to guarantee crack penetration. It appears that, no matter how tough an interface is, crack deﬂection can always be induced if the strength of the interface is low enough compared to the strength of the substrate. This may be of signiﬁcance for biological applications where brittle organic matrices can be bonded by relatively tough organic layers. Conversely, it appears that there is a lower bound for the ratio of the substrate strength to interfacial strength, below which penetration is guaranteed no matter how brittle the interface. Finally, it is noted that the effect of modulus mismatch on crack deﬂection is very sensitive to the mixed-mode failure criterion for the interface, particularly if the cracked layer is much stiffer than the substrate.},

These experimental results have been compared to numerical models, in which the influence of specific geometries and material present in the stack has been studied. A stress concentration region at the bottom of the line was observed and could be removed by corner rounding (fillet). Besides, the maximum stress is shifted away from the substrate.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to determine the effect induced by the nodular defects in optical thin films under laser irradiation. A strong correlation between the size distribution of defects in optical thin films, the deposition parameters and the laser damage threshold is found. With this approach of the defects in thin films, it confirms that the size of a nodular defect is a critical parameter, while the density of the defects is not. The observations of damaged areas, performed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), show that of the smallest ejected nodular defects associated with damaged zones, correspond to a critical mean size around 4 j.tm. A mechanical approach is also used to understand the role of the nodular defects under a mechanical solicitation. During the mechanical experiments it appears that depending on the nodular defects sizes, the initiation of cracking was more or less delayed. From the mechanical experiments, a critical size of about 4 j.tm is deduced. Besides, the analysis of these two different experiments points out that the laser damage induced by nodular defects is strongly related to mechanical fracture parameters.},

The ZrO2 surface was found to have a higher afﬁnity for moisture and IPA than SiO2. Under similar conditions, the amounts of moisture and IPA adsorbed on ZrO2 were comparatively greater and more temperature sensitive than on SiO2. ZrO2 ﬁlms also retained a signiﬁcant amount of moisture that could prove detrimental during subsequent thermal processing. At high temperatures, ZrO2 was found to catalyze decomposition of IPA. IPA adsorption on SiO2 was increased by pre-adsorbed moisture and it led to the formation of alkoxy groups at elevated temperatures. On the other hand, adsorption on ZrO2 was site limited; consequently, less IPA was adsorbed in presence of pre-adsorbed moisture.},

Also, further progresses in the development of new high power laser concepts are often directly limited by the availability of advanced optical components with high quality and LIDT-values. Nowadays, in the course of the development of optical materials with excellent quality and power handling capability, the problem of laser induced damage has shifted from the bulk to the surface of the optical component. The optical surface is objected to various production steps and environmental inﬂuences, which modify its structure and composition. Especially, the thin ﬁlm coating, which is deposited on the optical surface to adapt its reﬂectance and transmittance to the application, contributes predominantly to the reduction of the LIDTvalues. As a consequence, the measurement and optimization of the power handling capability of thin ﬁlms is considered as one of the primary research areas in modern optics technology and is supported by an extensive scientiﬁc community.},

We demonstrate that a model based on nanoparticle explosions is consistent with the observed initiation craters. Possible mechanisms for growth upon subsequent laser irradiation, including material modification and laser intensification, are discussed. Large aperture experiments indicate an exponential increase in damage size with number of laser shots. Physical processes associated with this growth and a qualitative explanation of selfaccelerated growth is presented. Rapid growth necessitates damage growth mitigation techniques. Several possible mitigation techniques are mentioned, with special emphasis on CO2 processing. Analysis of material evaporation, crack healing, and thermally induced stress are presented.},

	abstract = {This article presents the analysis for determining surface free energy uncertainty by the Owens–Wendt method (also known as the Kaelble–Owens–Wendt method). There are a lot of factors which have a substantial inﬂuence on the correctness of the contact angle measuring process. If a full measurement result is to be obtained, assessment of the result reliability is needed. In the case of distilled water wetting angle measurements, dispersion of the results may be assumed as a normal dispersion (according to the w2 test). In contrast, in the case of diiodomethane wetting angle measurements, dispersion of results cannot be treated as normal dispersion. This may demonstrate that if numerous factors are analysed, usually there is one dominant factor—in this case, a drop of liquid. The uncertainty resulting from different quantities of constants, given in the literature, is of great importance in the standard uncertainty overall error, both for the total surface energy and for its polar and dispersive components. Thus, it cannot be neglected at the examination reliability assessment.},

The properties of aluminum and tungsten ﬁlms on the following substrates have been studied: aluminum, glass, silicon and sapphire. By studying both soft ﬁlms on hard substrates and hard ﬁlms on soft substrates we are able to assess the effects of elastic and plastic inhomogeneity, as well as material pile-up, on the nanoindentation response. The data set includes Al/glass and W/sapphire, with the ﬁlm and substrate having nearly the same elastic properties. These systems permit the true contact area and true hardness of the ﬁlm to be determined from the measured contact stiffness, irrespective of the effects of pile-up or sink-in. Knowledge of the true hardness of the ﬁlm permits a study of the effects of the elastic modulus mismatch on the nanoindentation properties, using the measured contact stiffness as a function of depth of indentation.  2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

The electric ﬁeld enhancement around the edge of damage pits indeed exists and varies from 1.2 to 2.0 times. It is found that damage growth not only depends on the electric ﬁeld enhancement but also the local absorptive coefﬁcient by temperature ﬁeld calculation. The results also meet the reported damage growth behavior very well. A conclusion can be drawn that ﬁeld enhancement and potential defects or new generated defects during former pulses are jointly responsible for the damage growth. In addition, an inference can be drawn from theoretical analysis that the ﬂat bottom pit has been initiated by absorbing defect located at the H–L interfaces, which the peaks of electrical ﬁeld happen to.},

	abstract = {Large aperture laser pulse compressor designs use several diffraction gratings in series and sometimes tiled together to compress an amplified 1 to 10 ns pulse to 0.1 to 10 ps. The wavefront of the compressed pulse must be well controlled to allow focusing to a small spot on a target. Traditionally, multilayer dielectric gratings (MLDG) have been fabricated onto high thermal expansion substrates such as BK7 glass to prevent crazing and excessive bending due to tensile coating stress when operated in high vacuum. However, the high CTE of the BK7 can cause wavefront distortion and changes in the period of the grating. This work uses ion-assisted deposition of HfO2/SiO2 films to increase the compressive stress in MLD layers to allow use of silica substrates in the compressor vacuum environment. Stress, coating uniformity, and damage results are reported. The process was scaled to full size (91cm x 42cm) MLD gratings for use in the Osaka University LFEX laser system. Diffracted wavefront results from the full scale gratings is presented.},

	abstract = {Hf02/Si02 Brewster's angle polarizers are being developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for the National Ignition Facility. Damage threshold studies using a 3-ns pulse length 1064-nm laser have revealed a number of different damage morphologies such as nodular ejection pits, plasma scalds, and overcoat delaminations. Of these laser damage morphologies, delaminations have the most negative impact on fusion laser performance. By increasing the thickness of the Si02 overcoat, the delamination morphology is eliminated without significantly modifying the spectral characteristics of the coating. A model of the thermal mechanical response of the overcoats is presented for various Si02 overcoat thicknesses. The overcoat thickness influences the electric-field profile resulting in different thermal gradients between the outer Si02 and HfO2 layers. This modeling effort attempts to understand the relationship between the thermal stress distribution in the overcoat and the occurrence of delamination.},

	abstract = {It is well known that metallic films deposited electrolytically are in many cases liable to peel off if deposited to any considerable thickness. This is the case with nickel which, when deposited over a certain thickness, will curl up into beautiful close rolls, especially if it does not adhere very tightly to the body on which it is deposited. For example, if a piece of glass is silvered by any of the usual silvering solutions, and then nickel is deposited on the silver, it is found that the nickel and silver peel off the glass in close tight rolls almost at once. In ‘Practical Electro-Chemistry,' by Bertram Blount, reference is made on pp. 114 and 272 to the tendency of nickel to peel off, and it is stated that it “will peel—spontaneously and without assignable cause” (p. 272), but that a thick coating can be obtained by keeping the solution at between 50° and 90°C. The late Earl of Rosse tried, about 1865, to make flat mirrors by coating glass with silver chemically, and then electroplating with copper; but he found that, owing to the “contraction” of the copper film, it became detached from the glass. I have had the' same experience in protecting silver 61ms in searchlight reflectors by a film of electro-deposited copper, it being found that if the film of copper is more than 0.01 mm. thick peeling is apt to take place.},

	abstract = {Growing requirements for the optical and environmental stability, as well as the radiation resistance against high-power laser radiation, especially for optical interference coatings used in the ultraviolet spectral range, have to be met by new, optimised, thin-film deposition technologies. For applications in the UV spectral range, the number of useful oxide thin film materials is very limited due to the higher absorption at wavelengths near to the electronic bandgap of the materials. Applying ion-assisted processes offers the ability to grow dense and stable films, but in each case careful optimisation of the deposition process (evaporation rate, substrate temperature, bombarding gas, ion energy and ion current density) has to achieve a balance between densification of the layers and the absorption. High-quality coatings and multilayer interference systems with SiO2 as the lowindex material can be deposited by various physical vapour deposition technologies, including reactive e-beam evaporation, ionassisted deposition and plasma ion-assisted deposition. In order to improve the degradation stability of dielectric mirrors for use in UV free-electron laser optical cavities, a comparative study of the properties of SiO2, Al2O3 and HfO2 single layers was performed, and was addressed to grow very dense films with minimum absorption in the spectral range from 200 to 300 nm. The films were deposited by low-loss reactive electron-beam evaporation, by ion-assisted deposition using a ‘Mark II’ ion source, and by plasma ion-assisted deposition using the advanced plasma source. Optical and structural properties of the samples were studied by spectral photometry, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and reflectometry, as well as by investigation of the surface morphology. The interaction of UV radiation with photon energy values close to the bandgap was studied. For HfO2 single layers, laser-induced damage thresholds at 248 nm were determined in the 1-on-1 and 1000-on-1 test modes as a function of the deposition technology and film thickness. ᮊ 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the most popular uncertainty analysis method in LCA models defines uncertainty as quantified empirical judgment of the sources of the inventory data, which lacks the deviations due to the measurements of the data. We create a modified range method that leverages an array of publicly available data to represent the uncertainty of the actual values used in input-output models as ranges. Using these ranges, we propagate and visualize results from the uncertainties. We demonstrate the utility of the method using the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) model and focus on the uncertainty of estimated energy consumption. Results show that for energy consumption values in the model, average uncertainty ranges are within ±40\% with some outliers. Our method screens based on the magnitude of impacts and the relative uncertainty. Improved uncertainty assessment supports various types of decisions, such as product comparisons, hotspot analysis, and overall energy analyses. We used three case studies to demonstrate the implementations of our method. This method can be extended to additional types of flows, beyond energy, and to process-matrix-based LCA models.},

One of the most significant challenges for advanced composite materials is their high manufacturing energy intensity. This study explored the energy intensities of two lightweight FRP composite materials (glass- and carbonfiber-reinforced polymers), with three lightweight metals (aluminum, magnesium, and titanium) and structural steel (as a reference material) included for comparison. Energy consumption for current typical and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes were estimated for each material, deconstructing manufacturing process energy use by subprocess and manufacturing pathway in order to better understand the most energy intensive steps. Energy saving opportunities were identified and quantified for each production step based on a review of applied R\&D technologies currently under development in order to estimate the practical minimum energy intensity. Results demonstrate that while carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have the highest current manufacturing energy intensity of all materials considered, the large differences between current typical and state-of-the-art energy intensity levels (the “current opportunity”) and between state-of-the-art and practical minimum energy intensity levels (the “R\&D opportunity”) suggest that large-scale energy savings are within reach.},

	abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have performance characteristics (specific stiffness and strength) that are advantageous for clean energy products such as lightweight vehicles and efficient wind turbines. In transportation applications, the use of lightweight CFRP composites to replace conventional materials such as steel can provide major fuel energy savings during the use phase. However, carbon fiber (CF)-based composites are highly energy intensive to manufacture compared to conventional materials, and it can take many years for the fuel energy savings accumulated in the use phase to outweigh the increased manufacturing energy consumption. In some cases, it is possible that fuel energy savings will never overcome the embodied energy penalty. As a result, a full accounting of energy impacts based upon a life cycle analysis (LCA) approach is essential to evaluate the balance between increased energy demand to manufacture better performing products, and the downstream energy benefits resulting from their use. This approach can provide insights regarding where improvements in the manufacture and use of CF and CFRP composites are needed to realize timely, economy-wide energy benefits.},

	abstract = {The replacement of conventional materials with lightweight materials can improve vehicle fuel economy and associated emissions, but the choice of materials is dependent on complex design requirements. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have high stiffness and tensile strength with relatively low mass, and are increasingly being deployed in light-duty vehicles (LDVs). CFRP composite life cycle energy advantages are a balance between highly energy-intensive production processes and the energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions that mainly occur in the use phase for applications such as transportation. In the production phase, the manufacturing energy intensity of CFRP composites is greater than that of conventional metals. A review of commercially available manufacturing methods estimates the primary energy intensity of CFRP composites with 50\% fiber volume fraction to be roughly 800 MJ/kg, whereas that for conventional steel is only 50 MJ/kg [1]. Conventional steel is produced by processes that are well established and have undergone over 150 years of optimization and energy intensity improvements, while CFRP composites are currently produced by relatively new processes that have promising opportunities for optimization and energy intensity improvements. This analysis explores the substitution of a conventional steel LDV door with a carbon fiber reinforced polymer having a 50\% fiber volume fraction (50\%CFRP). The energy intensity of the 50\%CFRP composites is assessed for three scenarios corresponding to the current typical manufacturing techniques, the most energy efficient commercially available techniques, and the practical minimum energy intensity based on applied research technologies with commercial potential identified in an initial investigation. The effect of these variations in manufacturing energy intensity on the life cycle analysis is shown using the LIGHTEnUP Tool (Lifecycle Industry GHgas, Technology and Energy through the Use Phase) developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The break-even manufacturing energy intensity threshold for the 50\%CFRP composite LDV door to provide a net reduction in life cycle energy and associated carbon dioxide emissions is computed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical drivers affecting the design choices, manufacture and use of CFRP composites in LDVs.},

	abstract = {Tin coatings, widely used in electronics, are susceptible to the spontaneous eruption of ﬁne metal ﬁlaments or “whiskers”. Tin whiskers are a serious reliability issue in microelectronics, as they can cause short circuits and device failure. While it is generally accepted that whiskers grow to relieve compressive stresses, the speciﬁc mechanism for whisker formation is yet unknown. Data are presented to support an interface-transport mechanism for whisker nucleation and growth. This mechanism, involving the formation of a viscous layer at the interface between substrate and coating, could explain the extremely rapid growth of whiskers that has been observed experimentally.

Results indicate that substrate thickness strongly affects the thermal stress response of the thin film material. An oxide coating on a thin substrate generally exhibits either tensile or compressive stresses during elevated temperature processing, depending on the mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between substrate and coating. In the case of a thick substrate, however, the thin film coating is likely to exhibit both compressive and tensile stresses during its processing history. These results suggest that special consideration be paid to geometry in the selection of small-scale witness/test material to model the response of large optics to thermal processing.},

	abstract = {Following pull-off coating adhesion tests such as ASTM D4541, visual examination of the fracture surfaces often reveals intriguing fracture patterns where similar (and seemingly predictable) features are observed across like coating systems. Nonetheless, adhesion test stubs are typically discarded after a brief visual inspection or no inspection at all—suggesting a missed opportunity to gain further insight into fracture processes. This paper examines the pull-off adhesion test from a fracture mechanics perspective. We present two microscopy-based methods for extracting analytically useful fracture data from pull-off adhesion tests. First, we develop an energy-based method for obtaining mode mixity from observed crack kink angles, providing the powerful capability to disambiguate mode I and mode II fracture. We demonstrate agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions in a set of 1,305 crack path measurements for 111 pull-off adhesion test stubs, representing both single- and multi-layered coating systems. Second, we deploy a machine-learning based image segmentation technique (Trainable WEKA) to rapidly quantify the fractional area coverage of materials removed with the pull stub, enabling further insight into the surfaces most vulnerable to delamination in a layered coating stack. Beyond the immediate utility of these techniques for data enhancement in pull-off adhesion tests, these techniques also have long-term potential as tools for failure analysis in coated systems.},

	abstract = {Surface texture tailoring has the potential to increase the eﬀectiveness of dry particle collection wipes, as a wipe’s topographical features control the intimate surface contact made with particles on the substrate (critical for van der Waals-governed adhesion). However, texture-tailoring approaches have not yet been widely explored, in part because of a lack of understanding of the speciﬁc wipe topographies and wipe/particle interactions that maximize particle collection. Here we describe an in situ optical microscopy technique that enables direct observation of micrometer-scale particle−wipe interactions occurring at the wipe−substrate interface during contact sampling. The technique is demonstrated for nonwoven meta-aramid (Nomex) collection wipes with particles ranging from 1 to 90 μm in diameter and substrates of diﬀerent topographies (glass and nylon coil zipper). Experiments with hemispherically coated Janus particles allow rolling motions to be distinguished from sliding motions, providing detailed information about how particles move prior to capture or release by the wipe. Particle−ﬁber and particle− particle interactions are seen to play important roles in particle capture, suggesting that conventional sphere-on-plane models are inadequate to describe adhesion behavior in these systems. Micrographs show how loose, ﬂexible ﬁbers in roughened textile wipes interrogate the valleys of uneven substrate topographies, allowing capture of particles that might otherwise be trapped within the substrate’s grooves and depressions. The materials used in this work are speciﬁcally relevant to explosives detection, but the in situ visualization technique is transferable for the study of any application involving dry particle collection, such as toxic substance sampling and dust removal.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {The replacement of conventional materials with lightweight materials can improve vehicle fuel economy and associated emissions, but the choice of materials is dependent on complex design requirements. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have high stiffness and tensile strength with relatively low mass, and are increasingly being deployed in light-duty vehicles (LDVs). CFRP composite life cycle energy advantages are a balance between highly energy-intensive production processes and the energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions that mainly occur in the use phase for applications such as transportation. In the production phase, the manufacturing energy intensity of CFRP composites is greater than that of conventional metals. A review of commercially available manufacturing methods estimates the primary energy intensity of CFRP composites with 50\% fiber volume fraction to be roughly 800 MJ/kg, whereas that for conventional steel is only 50 MJ/kg. Conventional steel is produced by processes that are well established and have undergone over 150 years of optimization and energy intensity improvements, while CFRP composites are currently produced by relatively new processes that have promising opportunities for optimization and energy intensity improvements. This analysis explores the substitution of a conventional steel LDV door with a carbon fiber reinforced polymer having a 50\% fiber volume fraction (50\%CFRP). The energy intensity of the 50\%CFRP composites is assessed for three scenarios corresponding to the current typical manufacturing techniques, the most energy efficient commercially available techniques, and the practical minimum energy intensity based on applied research technologies with commercial potential identified in an initial investigation. The effect of these variations in manufacturing energy intensity on the life cycle analysis is shown using the LIGHTEnUP Tool (Lifecycle Industry GHgas, Technology and Energy through the Use Phase) developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The break-even manufacturing energy intensity threshold for the 50\%CFRP composite LDV door to provide a net reduction in life cycle energy and associated carbon dioxide emissions is computed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical drivers affecting the design choices, manufacture and use of CFRP composites in LDVs.},

Particles on the trap are thermally desorbed for detection by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or other analyses. A high trap sampling efficiency increases the chance of detection, and is affected by a number of factors. In particular, this work studies the effect of trap re-use on collection efficiency of organic explosives, namely 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), and correlates this data to quantifiable morphology changes. Collection efficiency was measured by liquid extraction of the traps with detection and quantitation by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Using silhouette microscopy for visualization of the trap texture, morphology changes were quantified by several measurements of trap roughness and hairiness, drawing from techniques and metrics used in the textiles industry. Nomex traps were visibly roughened by repeated re-use, and this was correlated with significant improvements in trap collection efficiency (11–57\%) depending upon the specific analyte and substrate combination interrogated. Teflon-coated fiberglass (TCFG) traps showed little change with repeated swiping and minimal to no improvement in particle collection efficiency. These results have direct implications for optimizing particle collection traps for use in security settings.},
