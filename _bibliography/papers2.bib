	abstract = {Tin coatings, widely used in electronics, are susceptible to the spontaneous eruption of ﬁne metal ﬁlaments or “whiskers”. Tin whiskers are a serious reliability issue in microelectronics, as they can cause short circuits and device failure. While it is generally accepted that whiskers grow to relieve compressive stresses, the speciﬁc mechanism for whisker formation is yet unknown. Data are presented to support an interface-transport mechanism for whisker nucleation and growth. This mechanism, involving the formation of a viscous layer at the interface between substrate and coating, could explain the extremely rapid growth of whiskers that has been observed experimentally.

	abstract = {Following pull-off coating adhesion tests such as ASTM D4541, visual examination of the fracture surfaces often reveals intriguing fracture patterns where similar (and seemingly predictable) features are observed across like coating systems. Nonetheless, adhesion test stubs are typically discarded after a brief visual inspection or no inspection at all—suggesting a missed opportunity to gain further insight into fracture processes. This paper examines the pull-off adhesion test from a fracture mechanics perspective. We present two microscopy-based methods for extracting analytically useful fracture data from pull-off adhesion tests. First, we develop an energy-based method for obtaining mode mixity from observed crack kink angles, providing the powerful capability to disambiguate mode I and mode II fracture. We demonstrate agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions in a set of 1,305 crack path measurements for 111 pull-off adhesion test stubs, representing both single- and multi-layered coating systems. Second, we deploy a machine-learning based image segmentation technique (Trainable WEKA) to rapidly quantify the fractional area coverage of materials removed with the pull stub, enabling further insight into the surfaces most vulnerable to delamination in a layered coating stack. Beyond the immediate utility of these techniques for data enhancement in pull-off adhesion tests, these techniques also have long-term potential as tools for failure analysis in coated systems.},

	abstract = {Surface texture tailoring has the potential to increase the eﬀectiveness of dry particle collection wipes, as a wipe’s topographical features control the intimate surface contact made with particles on the substrate (critical for van der Waals-governed adhesion). However, texture-tailoring approaches have not yet been widely explored, in part because of a lack of understanding of the speciﬁc wipe topographies and wipe/particle interactions that maximize particle collection. Here we describe an in situ optical microscopy technique that enables direct observation of micrometer-scale particle−wipe interactions occurring at the wipe−substrate interface during contact sampling. The technique is demonstrated for nonwoven meta-aramid (Nomex) collection wipes with particles ranging from 1 to 90 μm in diameter and substrates of diﬀerent topographies (glass and nylon coil zipper). Experiments with hemispherically coated Janus particles allow rolling motions to be distinguished from sliding motions, providing detailed information about how particles move prior to capture or release by the wipe. Particle−ﬁber and particle− particle interactions are seen to play important roles in particle capture, suggesting that conventional sphere-on-plane models are inadequate to describe adhesion behavior in these systems. Micrographs show how loose, ﬂexible ﬁbers in roughened textile wipes interrogate the valleys of uneven substrate topographies, allowing capture of particles that might otherwise be trapped within the substrate’s grooves and depressions. The materials used in this work are speciﬁcally relevant to explosives detection, but the in situ visualization technique is transferable for the study of any application involving dry particle collection, such as toxic substance sampling and dust removal.},
