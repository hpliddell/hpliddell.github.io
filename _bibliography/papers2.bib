	abstract = {Tin coatings, widely used in electronics, are susceptible to the spontaneous eruption of ﬁne metal ﬁlaments or “whiskers”. Tin whiskers are a serious reliability issue in microelectronics, as they can cause short circuits and device failure. While it is generally accepted that whiskers grow to relieve compressive stresses, the speciﬁc mechanism for whisker formation is yet unknown. Data are presented to support an interface-transport mechanism for whisker nucleation and growth. This mechanism, involving the formation of a viscous layer at the interface between substrate and coating, could explain the extremely rapid growth of whiskers that has been observed experimentally.

	abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have performance characteristics (specific stiffness and strength) that are advantageous for clean energy products such as lightweight vehicles and efficient wind turbines. In transportation applications, the use of lightweight CFRP composites to replace conventional materials such as steel can provide major fuel energy savings during the use phase. However, carbon fiber (CF)-based composites are highly energy intensive to manufacture compared to conventional materials, and it can take many years for the fuel energy savings accumulated in the use phase to outweigh the increased manufacturing energy consumption. In some cases, it is possible that fuel energy savings will never overcome the embodied energy penalty. As a result, a full accounting of energy impacts based upon a life cycle analysis (LCA) approach is essential to evaluate the balance between increased energy demand to manufacture better performing products, and the downstream energy benefits resulting from their use. This approach can provide insights regarding where improvements in the manufacture and use of CF and CFRP composites are needed to realize timely, economy-wide energy benefits.},

	abstract = {Following pull-off coating adhesion tests such as ASTM D4541, visual examination of the fracture surfaces often reveals intriguing fracture patterns where similar (and seemingly predictable) features are observed across like coating systems. Nonetheless, adhesion test stubs are typically discarded after a brief visual inspection or no inspection at all—suggesting a missed opportunity to gain further insight into fracture processes. This paper examines the pull-off adhesion test from a fracture mechanics perspective. We present two microscopy-based methods for extracting analytically useful fracture data from pull-off adhesion tests. First, we develop an energy-based method for obtaining mode mixity from observed crack kink angles, providing the powerful capability to disambiguate mode I and mode II fracture. We demonstrate agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions in a set of 1,305 crack path measurements for 111 pull-off adhesion test stubs, representing both single- and multi-layered coating systems. Second, we deploy a machine-learning based image segmentation technique (Trainable WEKA) to rapidly quantify the fractional area coverage of materials removed with the pull stub, enabling further insight into the surfaces most vulnerable to delamination in a layered coating stack. Beyond the immediate utility of these techniques for data enhancement in pull-off adhesion tests, these techniques also have long-term potential as tools for failure analysis in coated systems.},

	abstract = {Surface texture tailoring has the potential to increase the eﬀectiveness of dry particle collection wipes, as a wipe’s topographical features control the intimate surface contact made with particles on the substrate (critical for van der Waals-governed adhesion). However, texture-tailoring approaches have not yet been widely explored, in part because of a lack of understanding of the speciﬁc wipe topographies and wipe/particle interactions that maximize particle collection. Here we describe an in situ optical microscopy technique that enables direct observation of micrometer-scale particle−wipe interactions occurring at the wipe−substrate interface during contact sampling. The technique is demonstrated for nonwoven meta-aramid (Nomex) collection wipes with particles ranging from 1 to 90 μm in diameter and substrates of diﬀerent topographies (glass and nylon coil zipper). Experiments with hemispherically coated Janus particles allow rolling motions to be distinguished from sliding motions, providing detailed information about how particles move prior to capture or release by the wipe. Particle−ﬁber and particle− particle interactions are seen to play important roles in particle capture, suggesting that conventional sphere-on-plane models are inadequate to describe adhesion behavior in these systems. Micrographs show how loose, ﬂexible ﬁbers in roughened textile wipes interrogate the valleys of uneven substrate topographies, allowing capture of particles that might otherwise be trapped within the substrate’s grooves and depressions. The materials used in this work are speciﬁcally relevant to explosives detection, but the in situ visualization technique is transferable for the study of any application involving dry particle collection, such as toxic substance sampling and dust removal.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {The replacement of conventional materials with lightweight materials can improve vehicle fuel economy and associated emissions, but the choice of materials is dependent on complex design requirements. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have high stiffness and tensile strength with relatively low mass, and are increasingly being deployed in light-duty vehicles (LDVs). CFRP composite life cycle energy advantages are a balance between highly energy-intensive production processes and the energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions that mainly occur in the use phase for applications such as transportation. In the production phase, the manufacturing energy intensity of CFRP composites is greater than that of conventional metals. A review of commercially available manufacturing methods estimates the primary energy intensity of CFRP composites with 50\% fiber volume fraction to be roughly 800 MJ/kg, whereas that for conventional steel is only 50 MJ/kg. Conventional steel is produced by processes that are well established and have undergone over 150 years of optimization and energy intensity improvements, while CFRP composites are currently produced by relatively new processes that have promising opportunities for optimization and energy intensity improvements. This analysis explores the substitution of a conventional steel LDV door with a carbon fiber reinforced polymer having a 50\% fiber volume fraction (50\%CFRP). The energy intensity of the 50\%CFRP composites is assessed for three scenarios corresponding to the current typical manufacturing techniques, the most energy efficient commercially available techniques, and the practical minimum energy intensity based on applied research technologies with commercial potential identified in an initial investigation. The effect of these variations in manufacturing energy intensity on the life cycle analysis is shown using the LIGHTEnUP Tool (Lifecycle Industry GHgas, Technology and Energy through the Use Phase) developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The break-even manufacturing energy intensity threshold for the 50\%CFRP composite LDV door to provide a net reduction in life cycle energy and associated carbon dioxide emissions is computed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical drivers affecting the design choices, manufacture and use of CFRP composites in LDVs.},

Particles on the trap are thermally desorbed for detection by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or other analyses. A high trap sampling efficiency increases the chance of detection, and is affected by a number of factors. In particular, this work studies the effect of trap re-use on collection efficiency of organic explosives, namely 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), and correlates this data to quantifiable morphology changes. Collection efficiency was measured by liquid extraction of the traps with detection and quantitation by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Using silhouette microscopy for visualization of the trap texture, morphology changes were quantified by several measurements of trap roughness and hairiness, drawing from techniques and metrics used in the textiles industry. Nomex traps were visibly roughened by repeated re-use, and this was correlated with significant improvements in trap collection efficiency (11–57\%) depending upon the specific analyte and substrate combination interrogated. Teflon-coated fiberglass (TCFG) traps showed little change with repeated swiping and minimal to no improvement in particle collection efficiency. These results have direct implications for optimizing particle collection traps for use in security settings.},
